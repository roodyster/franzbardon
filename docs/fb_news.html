<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS by Jim Bardon
<br>Following are selected questions received from FRANZ BARDON NEWS subscribers
since the last issue:
<br>Q: I have a question. Once an exercise (in "Initiation Into Hermetics"
is mastered and one has gone to the next one, how often or frequently should
the former exercises be repeated-if at all--during the course of training?
<br>A: This is a good question. I hope the table included as the last page
of this newsletter will assist you.
<br>Q: Recently, I have discovered that despite all the big promises my
teachers made me while I was going to college to get a real estate license,
that I have not been able to get a good Job. I've lost the small-paying
job I found, and it seems that the financial conditions are so different
now than when I first started college.
<br>A: Regarding your loss of real estate job, as I mentioned to you in
your astrological reading, Divine Providence is trying to point out to
you at this time in your life, while Pluto crosses your Neptune, what parts
of your life are valid and which parts are due for change. Some of these
changes in perspective and goals may well come about in regards to your
career directions. On the one hand, Divine Providence definitely wants
you to succeed financially in order that you may perform more karma yoga
of increased value to His mission for this world. On the other hand, though,
it seems clear that the agents of the Zone Girdling the Earth wish you
to "get your act together" in the financial area. It is no good, as I'm
sure you've found, to simply expect that because I have this or that college
"degree" that I will be able to make money. Especially in today's world,
it is often a matter o; acquiring the skills that the MARKET REQUESTS,
rather than those stills that you think would be "fun" to have. Real estate
is a good example of this phenomenon. Now that the real estate market all
over the country is in a slump--and it will get worse--you've found out
the hard way that real estate skills are not desirable at this point for
an entry-level person such as yourself. Of course, your training will not
be a waste, for some day you will be able to use those skills. But, as
I've suggested earlier, you should look in the OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK
to take a close, hard look at reality. Only in this way will you be able
to easily discern those career/skill areas which will indeed be able to
pay your bills well over the next 10 years. Do not put off your research
in that book. If you do, you have no one but yourself to blame for your
own financial hardship. I can only make suggestions such as this; I cannot
twist your arm.
<p>A LETTER FROM OTTI VOTAVOVA The following is a translation of a letter
donated to the FRANZ BARDON FOUNDATION ARCHIVES this past year. It is written
in German by Franz's secretary, Otti Votavova, to a student. Please see
footnotes by Jim Bardon for clarifying comments. The letter was written
6 years after Franz had left his physical body (July 10, 1958), but before
Otti's death 9 years later on February 9, 1973. At the moment, this is
the only item which has been donated to the Archives.
<p>TRANSLATION:
<br>Praha, Czechoelovakia - July 2, 1964.
<br>Dear Mr.
<br>I have received your letter dated June 17th. I didn't answer immediately,
only because I wanted to you to receive, at least this first letter through
my girlfriend. I expect her for a very brief visit tomorrow. One is and
one becomes more and more an initiate, as soon as one starts to work on
oneself according to the instructions which are contained in the works
of F.B.
<br>It doesn't matter if one person is more initiated than another person.
Each human being is an individual and must work hard on him or herself
if he or she wants to become a high initiate. Nobody can walk the path
to perfection for somebody else.
<br>F.B. not only had students here, but they were scattered throughout
the world and some of those many students not only mastered the 3 published
works by F.B. in their practice but also a series of more Tarot cards in
whose wisdom they were personally initiated by F.B. It was absolutely no
problem for F.B. to supervise the progress of his advanced students in
various ways, no matter how great the distance may be. 1*
<br>Herm. Bauer in Freiburg/Breisgau published 3 scientific works as well
a "life - story" by F.B. Unfortunately the publisher reworked the "life-story"
to a attractive best-seller like occult novel. I had to read 40 pages before
I cooed discover an original sentence. Since that happened after the departure
of F.B. I cooed only communicate this unpleasant surprise to H. Bauer.
I didn't receive any answer to my letter referring to this matter, although
up to this incident I had a animated exchange of letters with the mentioned
publisher. 2*
<br>F.B. had dictated to me already a fourth scientific work entitled "The
Golden Book of Wisdom". But it was confiscated at this place and at mine
and it was destroyed. This kind of literature is not desired in our country.
3*
<br>That during the confiscation we both had to sacrifice all our other
works and books does not have to be emphasized. Besides the 4 scientific
works F.B. planned also to describe the 5th Tarot card for advanced students
as well as other instructional books about healing methods etc. His departure
which came unexpectedly for all of us prevented him of doing this of course.
<br>Not only the end of "Frabato" is falsified as you can see from my words
but a lot has been completely changed and the rest has been rearranged.
4*
<br>In his portrayal F.B. didn't want to write a novel as such, but he
wanted to explain to his students and readers why he was urged by the Divine
Providence to describe the first three Tarot cards and to give it to the
public. He would never have done it by his own motivation especially he
didn't do it in order to be recognized as a great writer. The book "Frabato"
is much more interesting in its original composition than in its clumsy
reworking [the 1st edition].
<br>Her. Bauer was also asking me to write something about the life of
F.B. which he wanted to use as an insertion in the life-story. I complied
with his wish but my composition of "In Memoriam" which is in accordance
with the truth has not been published. H. Bauer mentioned in his letter
of acknowledgment, that it was not suitable for the general public and
the majority of the readers would regard its content as phantasy. 5* He
himself found its content very interesting-so he wrote.
<br>I refrained from a description of the worldly life because it wouldn’t
profit anybody. Should you be completely mature for the hermetic knowledge
then the content of "In Memoriam" which I wrote will mean a lot to you.
I made a copy for you which you can keep for yourself so that you can,
read it often. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter but please
don't mention from where you received it. Be very careful how, you choose
your words. Hint only on what else you might want to know. 6* Not far away
from Zurich, that is in Lucerne, Stadthofstr. 6 lives Mr. Ing. Wilhelm
Koranyi, who visited F.B. personally tin Nov. 1957). He was our guest for
a few days and F.B. even took Mr. Koranyi to his home in Silesia, where
in many regards he profited in a few hours so much that it was no comparison
with all his previous experience.
<br>Since it is vacation-time right now it is possible, that Mr. Kor.,
and his wife are on a vacation. If you want to visit the mentioned person
then please phone him first if possible. Tel. Nr. 32426. I hope that you
are satisfied with my answer for now. I wish you lots of success and contentment
I greet you and sign
<br>Otti Votavova
<br>P.S. I will write to Ing. Kor, that he will give you more explanations
when you will turn to him.
<p>NOTES BY JIM BARDON:
<br>1* We can understand that although Hermes Trismegistos is no longer
incarnated in his previous physical body as Franz Bardon, that he is not
at all dead or lost to us. For those who accept H.T. as their sole Magus
Guru (magic instructor) and devote their lives to following his instructions
purely and without deviation or distortion, that same Great Personality
who was Franz Bardon will make Himself avail able for personal instruction.
Hermes Trismegistos will inspire you directly through your mental matrix
with the correct teachings as you progress, if your desire to hear his
voice is genuine.
<br>2* 0tti makes mention here of the first version of "Frabato the Magician",
published by Bauer Book Publishers in Germany. Since that time, the corrected
version has been published by Dieter Ruggeberg Book Publishers.
<br>3* Czechoslovakia is even to this day a repressive country which discourages
open discussion of metaphysical topics. Clearly, Otti was discouraged over
the behavior of the Nazis during the recently-ended World War II in her
country, which included the wholesale burning and outlawing of occult books.
<br>4* 0tti again refers to the first edition of "Frabato". The new version
has been corrected.
<br>5* The "In Memoriam" is found in all current editions of "Frabato".
She refers again to the events connected with the first edition only.
<br>6* The Czechoslovakian government frowns, even to this day, on contacts
with United States citizens; it is a Soviet-dominated country.

DEPRESSIONS will plague the Western &amp; European worlds, as well as ONE
MAJOR WORLD WAR. Unless you'd enjoy performing your Hermetic exercises
standing in a bread line, or while living in a cardboard box as a street
person, you must become serious about preparing a financial strategy while
there is still time.
<br>RECOMMENDATIONS:
<br>(#1) START TOUR OWN BUSINESS. Or you will find yourself unemployed
when your boss has to cut costs. Take a good number of courses on how to
run a small business at a local college, so yours will be successful and
will not fail (as do 95% of all small businesses in the first 5 years).
<br>(#2) LEARN SOME BASIC IBM-PC COMPUTER SKILLS, especially spreadsheet
(bookkeeping) and word processing (typing) software. Or you won't be able
to compete as a computer illiterate.
<br>(#3) SUBSCRIBE TO THE FOLLOWING PERIODICALS and borrow all the books
they recommend from your public library. Don' t complain about the subscription

<p>CHECKLIST OF EXERCISES (FROM STEP ONE) TO CONTINUE DAILY Make a Xerox
copy of this page and post it, somewhere convenient your home. The following
drills should be made a permanent part of your routine as time permits,
although not necessarily performed in your magic room as a formal exercise.
As a general rule, one does not abandon previously completed exercises,
just because he or she has started on the next Step. Rather, one's daily
lifestyle becomes gradually more and more saturated with magical exercises.
In this way, you will not lose the benefit of all your previous exercises.
The numbers in parenthesis refer to the Step and Type and Exercise number
from the Training Guide. For instance, (I-M-1) means "Step 1-Mental Exercise-#1".
"A"=Astral "P"=Physical
<br>(I-M-3) THOUGHT FOCUSING While walking about or performing some chore,
carefully control your thoughts so that nothing else is allowed to distract
you from your intended thoughts, no matter how loudly outside thought forms
may impinge against your consciousness.
<br>(I-M-4) THOUGHT VACANCY Similar to (I-M-3) above, but with the goal
being to completely force out all impinging thoughts from your environment,
while holding your own mind vacant. This can be done while walking through
a shopping mall or other intensely astrally polluted environment, and will
keep this part of the brain firm and strong.
<br>(I-P-1) PHYSICAL HABITS Body brushing, stretching exercises, avoiding
carcinogenic substances on the body or in food, enemas, salt poison-drawing
baths, distilled water, lecithin.
<br>(I-P-2) CONSCIOUS BREATHING As often as possible during the day, practice
breathing in your specific already-fulfilled desire along with the physical
air element (which always contains astral fire, water, air &amp; earth)
as food for the body. This can be done anywhere.
<br>(I-P-3) EUCHARISTIC EATING &amp; DRINKING Charge all your food &amp;
drink first.
<br>(I-P-4) CONSCIOUS BODY BATHING Force out hindering astral contamination.
<br>(I-P-5) CONSCIOUS EYE BATHING "
