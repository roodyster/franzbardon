<p>Dear reader, you probably know that I have set up this Franz Bardon
dedicated website, in the first place because I like Franz Bardon's system
and also to bring some&nbsp; interesting informations about Bardon's life
and teachings to a broader audience.
<p>In order to protect my good (I hope) reputation and to prevent that
my name or site is linked to negative activities I will always announce
it in public, if someone dares to use Franz Bardon's name and/or system
in a sect-like manner. Like Mr. Paul M. puts it: "That people come along
and prey on the gullible is to be expected. What you can't do is make people
more intelligent. You can't inject them&nbsp; with brains. All you can
do is show how such activities are incompatible with the stated views of
their leader". And: "We are students who work alone, making our own mistakes,
teaching ourselves. This was Mr. Bardon's plan or vision."
<p>A year ago I got the first inquiries about a certain Franz Bardon Group
in France. I was told about strange activities, practices and hierarchies.
You know, people talks a lot about others and very often the rumors are
not true. So I decided not to do anything at first and to ask for more
information. Even a group with good intentions may decline soon as money
and interpersonal relationships comes in. So most times I'm ignoring bad
rumors and feedback. But in this case the accusations are so heavy, that
I have to say something about it, just to warn our fellow French Franz
Bardon friends. I'm no FBI agent neither a police-officer and therefore
I cannot prove the accusations that other people told me about. For this
reason I will give no names: the persons involved will know whoever is
addressed in this case. Furthermore its my sincere hope, that all the following
is just a bad joke and has nothing to do with objective facts. On the other
hand there are STRONG INDICATIONS that at least a part of the following
is true.
<p>The story goes like this: A number of years ago a man founded in France
an esoteric group claiming to be an High Initiate and therefore to be able
to guide others on the spiritual path. He used Franz Bardons System as
a basis for his teachings adjusting the methods as explained by Bardon
in his own way. That Bardon devised his method to give people the opportunity
and freedom to work without any personal teacher was ignored by this man.
As time went by his organization grew rapidly, and someone argued that
he used his magical abilities to mesmerize people and to attract them to
his group.
<br>Remember the Indian Guru Sri Rajnesh from Poona who bought 20 or 30
Rolls-Royce just for fun with the money of his followers? It's always the
same story. This French guy managed also to have a donation here and a
gift there using questionable methods to acquire wealth. And we must put
the comparison between Rajnesh and our man even further: do you know what
I mean? Yes, I'm talking about SEX. Our man is accused of using his position
as the highest ranking person of this organization, as a believed illuminated
magician and a almost Godlike Being, to ... (use your own imagination here).
<br>Therefore it's no surprise at all that such a man&nbsp; got the attention
of French officials. Even <a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/rueggebe.html'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/rueggebe.html#milli'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/rueggebe.html#milli">Jim
Milligan</a> in the USA was watched by the FBI: everyone can read the FBI
crime report on the Internet which lists Jim (?Bardon?) Milligan as a watched
and suspected criminal. (Simply do an Altavista search with the keywords
"FBI crime report" and "Jim Milligan".) Likewise also our man and his organization
are reported to have been investigated by the French secret services.
<p>The accusations in the spiritual realm are also quite severe. By distorting
Bardon's methods this self-proclaimed master is accused of keeping his
followers away from the genuine practices which guarantee a sound progress
on the path. And that's not all: our man is said to use directly his magical
powers to attract people, then to weaken their will power and reasoning
abilities with the outcome that his followers will be addicted to him and
his group, like it often happens with sects. He is furthermore directly
accused of using black magic (sorcery) on his followers. About this kind
of activities I have been told the following (I just removed the original
name of the person in case replacing it by an X):
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><i>"I think he borrows his powers from 3 black sorcerers that
are rich and that look very cool and friendly. Those sorcerers have a very
cool apartment in Paris like a hotel, in a sunny place (it is not a good
idea to try to know exactly where it is located). Usually when X makes
a meeting, the sorcerers join in their hotel and perform magic on the people
of the meeting, while X makes his speech. The energies they send make feel
people&nbsp; better, but in all cases make sure that the attendants of
the meeting are under control. They also damage people's consciousness,
so that they stay under control. Until now, X was always hiding his darkest
influence and therefore it was hard to figure out how he is doing harm.
For example the way he used to operate was to use an energy filled with
a positive idea, but melted with total control of the people's mind. I
mean that if you focus on the energy he uses, or if you receive it, on
the beginning you will feel better, but on the long run this energy will
influence you. This is a very good (bad) trick of sorcery, because it can
only be discovered by an occultist that seriously studies the origin and
the facts of this kind of black magic. Ordinary followers don't notice
anything at all, they feel better and become addicted to this kind of energy,
like a smoker is addicted to nicotine. They also surrender to the will
of X. But until know, the bad effect of his magic has never been that obvious,
this was the reason why I couldn't make too much noise about it. But the
last time I went to Paris, the guy I met showed me a stone, that had been
filled with an energy by X. This work was great. It was so good that it
has probably been made by a spirit (a bad one of course). The facts about
this stone are the following: If someone wears that stone, the effects
are:</i>
<br><i>---> Less willpower, so that you can be influenced.</i>
<br><i>---> Altering the way to see what's good and what's bad ... I mean
that it enters your mental and changes the way you respect people, the
way you plan to treat them, it just makes you "angry"; another point is
that this kind of influence is hard to notice ...</i>
<br><i>---> Damages your earth element, so that you feel weak, the symbol
is that it's like "cutting your legs". What will happen is that you loose
your positive believes which enable you to live your life and on the long
run you loose love and money.</i>
<br><i>---> Fills your mental with obscure theories.</i>
<p><i>As a result the combination of those energies stick you to X. (loosing
of willpower,&nbsp; money and self-confidence ...)</i>
<p><i>THAT IS THE WAY OF ACTING OF A PURE SORCERER."</i></blockquote>

<p><br>So far the report of a French friend of Franz Bardon. I hope that
the above said is pure fancy, but I must warn all people who are planning
to join X's group that they may run into serious problems.
<p>Furthermore I asked Mr. R&uuml;ggeberg about X. and his group and Rueggeberg
told me the following (again I removed the original name of the person
in case replacing it by an X.):
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>(Letter dated Wuppertal, 31. May 1999, by Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg)
<p><i>"I have been informed some time ago by my French friends about the
NEGATIVE activities of Mr. X. But I don't know anything specific about
him and his group. Mr. X has never contacted me and he has never done anything
to support the work of Franz Bardon. Of course the abuse of Franz Bardon's
name and work is a pity but also here in Germany certain persons are misusing
Bardon's name and works for selfish means. I consider it a waste of time,
money and energy to use legal means in these cases. I prefer to use my
resources to make Bardon's work better known in general. Furthermore jurisdiction
is in a lousy condition not only here in Germany as I know from my political
studies. ...</i>
<p><i>Signed: Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg.</i>
<p>[<i>Original German text:</i>
<br><i>(Brief vom: Wuppertal, 31. Mai 1999)</i>
<br><i>"&Uuml;ber die NEGATIVEN Aktivit&auml;ten von X. wurde ich vor einiger
Zeit u.a. durch meine franz&ouml;sischen Freunde unterrichtet. Aber Einzelheiten
&uuml;ber den Herrn und seine Gruppe sind mir nicht bekannt. Herr X. hat
sich noch nie mit mir in Verbindung gesetzt und auch noch nie zur Unterst&uuml;tzung
der Werke von Franz Bardon beigetragen. Der Mi&szlig;brauch des Namens
und des Werks ist nat&uuml;rlich bedauerlich, aber auch hier in Deutschland
gibt es Menschen, die seinen Namen und sein Werk f&uuml;r eigenn&uuml;tzige
Zwecke mi&szlig;brauchen. Von meiner Zeitnot abgesehen halte ich es f&uuml;r
&uuml;berfl&uuml;ssig, gegen manche Dinge mit Rechtsmitteln vorzugehen,
denn das kostet Geld und Kraft, die ich lieber f&uuml;r die Verbreitung
der B&uuml;cher einsetze. Au&szlig;erdem ist das Rechtswesen nicht nur
in Deutschland in einem miserablen Zustand, wie mir aus meinen politischen
Studien bekannt ist.</i>
<br><i>...</i>
<br><i>Gezeichnet: Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg.</i>]</blockquote>

<p><br>If I have unjustly accused Mr. X and his group , then I have to
apologize for it. On the other hand it's always a good idea to remind people
to be very cautious in these regards.

<h3>
Further evidences for a sect-like behavior:</h3>
A French Franz Bardon friend was able to find even further evidences for
the sect-like behavior of the group mentioned above.
<p>You can find an OFFICIAL REPORT of the French police? (Secret Service?)
(of course in French language) on the Internet with a detailed report about
the criminal activities of the group. Just do an Altavista-search with
the name of the person in question. I cannot give you the name, so please
don't send me emails asking me for the name. Just ask other people involved
with Franz Bardon on the net. Some of them know all details.

Final part.</h3>
This will be the final part about this issue; I will not add any further
comments about this group. I think we have presented enough material that
every reader can reach his own conclusions.
<br>The following is the unaltered translation by Josh of a submission
to the French Franz Bardon Forum about a meeting of this group last year.
Furthermore you can read also the comments by Josh who has more material
about it on <a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Jardin/7843/index.html'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Jardin/7843/index.html'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Jardin/7843/index.html">his

<blockquote>Dear Mr Allen,
<br>This is the translation of a french post about X, who is under suspicion
of sectlike activities.
<br>As i watched and investigste that myself, i can say that i agree with
the following at 100%.
<br>The translation is made by myself, therefore it could not be that perfect.
<br>Hope you enjoy it

<p><i>He wrote:</i>
<br><i>I agree with the dumb and obvious abuse of Franz Bardon Teachings
in france.</i>
<br><i>I had myself this experience when i went to this public "fake"Forum
, that has been advertised in Mr Paul Allen's Website , in Paris march
1998.</i>
<p><i>Here is the sum up of the meeting:</i>
<br><i>They began with 2 hours of advertising about the 3 next meetings
that were supposed to show what one could do with Bardon's teachings.</i>
<br><i>-they also said that Dr M.K would be there(see exhibit 4).</i>
<br><i>_they made indirectly fun of Dieter Ruggeberg,who was supposed to
be short on money(see exhibit 4), and that "needed their help"</i>
<br><i>_the claiming that the "master from Africa was there , on the mental
plane(of course it is X), that was able to open the chakra of the planet(??)
that have been closed a few minutes after because of the "bad vibrations"
that were going out of those same chakras(??)</i>
<br><i>_proposed to sell Magic Sticks to "dumbs"(i am sorry that's the
translation!-see exhibit II)</i>
<br><i>_Huge Advertisement for the "master" services(exhibit III)</i>
<br><i>example: we were together in Africa, suddenly i asked the master
for a project..finally he accepted that...Divine Providence allowed that...</i>
<p><i>After that , we had 1hour 30minutes of demonstrations(they have no
time to spend&nbsp; because time is money 20$ the meeting with 250 people
(see exhibit 5)</i>
<p><i>Projection of ten times the same picture(a candle :same as the website
EXHIBIT 7 ) while 45 seconds</i>
<br><i>"to give a major help on Bardon's exercises"</i>
<p><i>And in the end , the best part of the meeting was the supposed "use"
of a so called "magical formulae" ("kaballistic") to modify a big rock
that was in front of the scene so that it can be easely lift.</i>
<p><i>1 of the 3 Expert in mass -manipulation explained,to be carefull,
with good marketing skills (making that very funny to watch-there is irony-)
that the experienced could work only with a "Good receptive guy" , choosen
by the "african master"'s supporters, -one have to notice that watching
someone lifting a weight is a very subjective thing, and that it is the
"african master" who knows how to do that , "and from a very long distance",
witch is supposed to give a picture of the so-called "level" of the "master",
and that is supposed to make us consider the "fantastic" "experience" ,
explained from the very beginning.</i>
<p><i>The "receptive guy" choosen by the advertisers , with the help of
"Divine Providence" of course, has to lift the stone before and after the
magik-kaballa formulae has been wishpered.</i>
<br><i>The stone is lift two times :</i>
<br><i>A first test with a guy wich really seemed to be -divinely?- exhausted,
and the second test was with a young girl that had to take a friendly nap
after that exhausting experience.</i>
<br><i>The advertisers explained that they are not the cause of such miracles
(that can be a good thing to avoid prosecution in court,)</i>
<br><i>After that, i , the writer of this sum up , leave the meeting ,
after having clearly explained his point of view to the journalist that
was the co-organiser(original nota of josh: her name is Char.... but she
changed it...see exhibit 6)</i>
<p><i>Ps:greetings for the serious&nbsp; interest you seem to have on Bardon's
work.</i>
<p><i>YA</i>
<br><i>Please do not hesitate to put my post on the forum , because i am
avare of the concequences such quack can produce on the public, and the
media.</i>
<br><i>I prefer to keep my identity secret.</i>
<br><i>"</i>
<br><i>END OF MESSAGE</i>
<br><i>Josuah Hutchinson's notes:</i>
<br><i>EXHIBITS:</i>
<br><i>i heard a few things connected to those events.</i>
<br><i>First, let me apologise for the translation, but it is very hard
for me to translate all the IRONY , and also the original smart way it
was written.</i>
<br><i>French language is very appropriate For irony.</i>
<p><i>EXHIBIT 4</i>
<br><i>Some organisers called Ruggeberg, or Dr M.k, I do not remember.As
Ruggeberg said he never had contact with those people , they probably met
Dr M.K.</i>
<br><i>what happened, is that the reply of the magician was "we do not
need advertisement or tv shows, we need people to practice."</i>
<br><i>they didn't like that reply.</i>
<br><i>For this reason they made fun of Dieter Ruggeberg, who is reported
to have problems financing Bardon's Books.</i>
<br><i>Personnaly, i watched the amounts of books sold , and i can say
it is huge.Because of those kind of sect, a lot of Bardon books are sold
, there sould not be so much books sold, for that reason i really wander
why&nbsp; Mr Ruggeberg have financial problems.</i>
<br><i>Bardon Books are often sold out...!</i>
<p><i>They made fun of ruggeberg because he represents the old timers that
PRACTICE.They consider that the financial problems are a failure and that
they are able to correct it("he needs our help").They make so much money...</i>
<p><i>EXHIBIT II</i>
<br><i>those are devices filled by energy by X.</i>
<br><i>They have an influence and are advertised in this organization.</i>
<br><i>Same category as the "Black Magic Stone" that can be found on Mr
Allen's Website.</i>
<br><i>http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/frenchsect.html</i>
<br><i>Those devices are sometimes given in a meeting, sometimes you buy
them aside.</i>
<br><i>The so called "african master" make them operate just in a few seconds
, by -according to me-an Ankur</i>
<br><i>sentence.</i>
<br><i>Last device that has been checked by myself and 2 other occultist
was harmfull.(dangerous)</i>
<br><i>They sometimes claim that they can give them for free,but ,according
to what i heard, they make pay for it.</i>
<p><i>EXHIBIT III</i>
<br><i>The "master" , X, makes pay each action , or each personal meeting
$100 .the meeting usually last 30seconds to 5 minutes.</i>
<br><i>He also gives Mantras (sentences) that are supposed</i>
<br><i>to bring you good things.</i>
<br><i>Take a look at my website for comments on ANkur</i>
<p><i>EXHIBIT 5</i>
<br><i>"Time is money" is one of the favorite sentences of his followers.They
also enjoy "are you making business or are you making money?"</i>
<br><i>Usually the meeting cost $200-$250 , with 100 to 200 people attending
the meeting.</i>
<br><i>The benefits are evaluate at $50 000.00 USD each average meeting
.</i>
<br><i>Of course some meetings are very cheap, to gain newcomers, and those
for the oldtimers are very expensive(up to $2 000 reported,maybe more)</i>
<p><i>EXHIBIT 6</i>
<br><i>Many of his followers changed their names.</i>
<br><i>The official version is that it helps "the personnality change and
improvement, because every name carries a vibration"</i>
<br><i>According to me, there is also a practical reason:</i>
<br><i>the secret services.</i>
<br><i>As that group has been investigated for a long time by the french
secret services, changing one's name can be very usefull.</i>
<br><i>It is harder for investigators to get informations, and also, when
you go to court, it his harder to prove that "the guy called P is in fact
L...etc.."</i>
<br><i>Also the guy X fled france and went to Africa.</i>
<br><i>For what reason?</i>
<br><i>I have reports that individuals that were fed up with this guy (lady
problems i think) and that were after him.Some other says it is the Secret
services, some other , the IRS.</i>
<br><i>Maybe it is just a combination of all that...</i>
<p><i>EXHIBIT 7</i>
<br><i>This is the belief of this order:that their so called "master" has
the ability to master kaballa, and therefore send vibrations that can improve
you, and also help your bardon practice.</i>
<br><i>Take a look at my website for more details</i>
<br><i>They claim to be able to put this vibrations on tv, internet...</i>
<p><i>FINAL NOTE</i>
<br><i>X is old and is maybe going to die soon.</i>
<br><i>Even if the last reports that arrived in my office(laughts!!) claim
that this guy has never had so much followers, i think that in the long
run, he won't be a problem.I give all that as an informative content.</i>
<p><i>AMAZING FACT: the last report shows that X enjoys performing illusionism,
wich is quite amazing, because Bardon always emphasized that those kind
of practices were only trying to imitate the real magicians, and that sometimes
similar entertainment was produced by the dark forces to make people think
that magic does not exist. FUN!!</i>
<p><i>Last amazing fact:</i>
<br><i>An occult magician,&nbsp; Mr Fountain ,is supposed to have reported
the following:</i>
<br><i>After X meeting, and in X's tradition, there is always a time were
they eat together, whith X the fake"master".Now what Mr Fountain explains
is, that an energy is put into the food by the bad people supporting X.</i>
<br><i>I can not say wether or not this is right or wrong, mr Fountain
does not seem to like to give too much details about that.If i have time,
i will try to find out more about his claimings.</i>
<br><i>On an Ankur point of view, this is possible, that is the reason
why this an interesting fact.</i>
<br><i>When i asked Mr Fountain about the reasons of such a behavior, he
told me "they want to be the first to demonstrate those kind of activities."</i>
<br><i>As i do not realy know Mr fountain very well, i guess he tought
that he told me a little too much!</i>
<p><i>PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT I CAN NOT SAY IF THE FOOD STORY IS RIGHT
OR WRONG,BUT IN THEORY , THIS IS POSSIBLE.</i></blockquote>
