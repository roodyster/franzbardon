<h2>
Key to the true Kabbalah.<br>
<br>
<u><font size=+1>Different element attributes to a given letter.</font></u></h2>

<ol>&nbsp;
<br>When we study the elemental attributes of the letters in Bardon's thirth
book "Key to the true Kabbalah" (First English edition, translated by Gerhard
Hanswille, Mercur Publishing, 1996) we notice eventually that the elemental
attributes mentioned in the second part of step I (The Mysticism of Letters
from p. 73 - 79) and in step IV (Kabbalisticae Elementorum p. 98-101) don't
match. These conflicting attributions may be a source of confusion for
the beginning quabbalistic student.
<p>Stejnar explains these discrepancies in the following way:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol><b>"We must not forget, that the letters have different elemental vibrations
on different planes. Just notice what Bardon points out on p. 91: "Every
letter has one, sometimes even two, element vibrations". And here he means
not only the C,&Auml;,&Ouml; (and the omitted R)",</b></ol>

<p><br>Stejnar continues.
<br>&nbsp;
<ol><b>"The exercises in step IV refer to the prime quality of a letter
on the vital-plane. On the other hand those mentioned in step 1 refer to
the color of a given letter: i.e. to the astral plane."</b>
<p><b>It's very important to understand, that the letters have to be used
onto different planes. ... the same prime qualities produce onto different
planes diverse qualitative elemental properties. Therefore most letters
have to be mastered with two different elemental attributes. BTW, the missing
R on page 94 has to be practiced on the mental and astral plane with the
akashic- and water-qualities but onto the material-world/plane with the
quality of earth in the legs.</b></ol>

<h2>
<u><font size=+1>12-tone versus 10-tone scale.</font></u></h2>

<ol>&nbsp;
<br>Every musician when reading through the third step "Aqua Vitae Kabbalisticae"
of Bardon's Kabbalah, which adds the tone quality to the letters, will
immediately notice, that there are missing two notes of the western harmonic-tone-scale:
the E and the sharp A (A#).
<p>Stejnar outlines his opinion in this regard:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol><b>"Initially I thought, that Bardon had purposely chosen a 10-tone-scala,
because the number 10 is of fundamental importance for his Kabbalah. But
considering new findings combined with practical experiences I changed
my mind and I'm now convinced that this is again an error due to transcription
problems or due to a bad manuscript."</b></ol>

<p><br>Stejnar cites then a number of sources by recent, mediaeval and
antic magicians and philosophers to substantiate his opinion, e.g. Fludd,
Pythagoras, Thimus, the Sephir Yetzirah: all used a 12-tone (harmonic)
scale for their cosmologies.
<p>Nevertheless Stejnars efforts to prove his point of view, some hermetic
magicians reject this position.
