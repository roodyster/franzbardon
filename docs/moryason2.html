  <i>Alexandre Moryason is the French occultist who translated Bardon's three 
  main works into the French language. He added a lot of footnotes/explanations 
  to his translations which are very interesting for every student of magic working 
  with Bardon's system.</i> <br>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><i>Alexandre Moryason authorized me to translate his comments contained in 
  his French translation of Bardon's 3 books into English.</i> <br>
  <i>Actually the entire work has been done by Mr. Orion Tschudi, who organized 
  the translation. I would like to thank Mr. Tschudi here in the name of all</i> 
  <i>English speaking Friends of Franz Bardon for this extensive and excellent 
  work.</i></p>
<p><i><br>
  My special thanks goes to the professional translator <b>Jocelyne Demers</b> 
  (contact: (416) 925 5811 - Toronto, Canada; email swan14@globalserve.net) who 
  did the entire translation for free !!! </i></p>

<p>Translators preface:
<blockquote>"T.N." stands for "Translator's Note", which is inscribed in the French 
  edition's footnotes as "Ndt". The Translator thus referred to is that who translated 
  the text into French, providing me with my original, French language material. 
  <p> In this document, the footnotes, translated into English from the actual 
    of the French language edition, are preceded by the word "Page" followed by 
    the number of the page on which they do appear in the French language, that 
    followed by such words or phrases as relevant, immediately preceding the call 
    for a given footnote, thusly: the French word or phrase, then its English 
    rendition, then the call for the footnote. Then, in the next paragraph, the 
    footnote itself. If there are several calls for footnotes on a given page, 
    such calls, including the relevant excerpts from the body of the text and 
    their English translations, are gathered in one paragraph, followed by the 
    notes, one paragraph for each of the latter. For example, in the French edition's 
    main text on page 24, the words "un Mage" are followed by a call for footnote 
    1 and further down, on page 25, there appears the phrase "exactement par les 
    mêmes Lois", followed by the call for footnote 2; further down still on page 
    25 there comes the phrase "de "blanche" ou de "noire"". So, 1 write then, 
    "Page 24, "un Mage", "a Magus" 1. And then, "Page 25, exactement par les même 
    Lois", "exactly through the same Laws"2; "de "blanche" ou de "noire"", ""white" 
    or "black""3. Following such a statement there appears, in a distinct paragraph 
    and the order called, any footnote for that page. Footnotes are numbered consecutively 
    throughout the book, from 1 to 102.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Page Page 24, "un Mage", "a Magus"1.</b> 
  <p>1) TN.: Franz Bardon designates the operator in Magic thus, be that a man 
    or a woman; the latter however shall not perform any Ritual of Evocation at 
    the time of her menses.<br>
  <hr WIDTH="100%">
  <p><b>Page 25, "exactement par les mêmes Lois", "exactly through the saine Laws"2; 
    "de «blanche» ou de «noire», ""white" or "black""3,- "malsain ou mauvais", 
    "pernicious or bad"4.</b>
  <p>2) T.N.: Just as a knife is used to cut the bread or to kill, fire, to warm 
    and to cook the food or to put to death the individual bound to a stake.
  <p>3) T.N.: Magic is "Knowledge" of the Universal Laws and Knowledge of the 
    ways the latter act. When one knows GENUINELY those ways,one can but follow 
    the Divine Plan or Program; if one does not do so, one believes that one knows 
    them, but one does nothing of the kind. The title of Magus and the word "Magic" 
    must therefore be understood and used in their genuine sense, and this is 
    why, at this stage of understanding, of consciousness and of action, the "white" 
    and the "black" do not exist, sole is the Divine Plan that carries Itself 
    out.
  <p>4) T.N.: The Negative is called in Occultism "Negative Good" for it is programmed 
    by God to destroy what hinders Life and Consciousness. When that Force is 
    used to destroy Life and Consciousness, it becomes, by the deed of the men 
    who lead it astray from its primordial course, "evil&quot;. But the Universal 
    Laws have not at all programmed "evil&quot; such as we mean it. "Must Irepeat 
    again that the Best Adepts searched the Universe during millennia and nowhere 
    found trace of such a maker of Machiavellian plans"... specified the Master 
    Kout Houmi.<br>
  <hr WIDTH="100%">
  <p><b>Page 26, "d'un point de vue, non pas religieux mais conforme au Plan Universel&quot;, 
    "from a standpoint not religious but in compliance with the Universal Plan"5; 
    "qu'il use de ces forces', "that he uses those forces"6; "Le sorcier", "The 
    sorcerer'7.</b> 
  <p>5) T.N.: Can one say that Magnetism is "bad" in opposition to Electricity 
    which, in turn, would be "good"? Now, for the Magus (as for the contemporary 
    scientist), those are indeed the two forces that one is to use for the Good, 
    according to the Divine Plan, and not to do "evil&quot; by working in an erroneous 
    fashion with them.
  <p>6) T.N.: In order to collaborate, in consequence, to the Divine Plan and 
    not to contradict It.
  <p>7) T.N.: Franz Bardon generally calls thus the mere ignoramuses, even those 
    that operate in Magic with well intentioned motives for, on account of their 
    low spirituality and of a lack of purification, they necessarily reach, in 
    Evocation, planes and beings of a "doubtful" polarity.<br>
  
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 28, "la Magie de l'empathie," "the Magic of empathy"8.</b> 
  <p>8) T.N.: From the Greek "&eacute;n", in, and "pathos", what one experiences. 
    Empathy is that phenomenon which consists in projecting oneself into another 
    being (animal or human) and in being genuinely able to feel or experience 
    all which that being feels or experiences. 
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 34, "et comment agir en tant qu'~tre spiritueP, "and how to act as 
    a spiritual being"9.</b>
  <p>9) T.N.: The higher mental, tuned in by the lower mental (that of which we 
    are generally aware and which enables us to say " I think") is actually the 
    transmitter of a higher reality inherent to the human being, his Spiritual 
    Self and His Support. This genuine Self is the Spirit. The Orient, which has 
    kept a knowledge in depth of the Universe and of the human being's exact structure, 
    calls it "Atrnan" or 7th Principle. His support is named "Buddhi" or 6th Principle; 
    the higher mental, "Buddhi-Manas" and the lower mental, "Kama-Manas". Thus 
    by a mental work of an abstract type, one does activate the higher mental 
    and, as the result of this, the Spirit can emanate over the denser planes. 
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 35, 1e Nom d'une Intelligence", "the Name of an Intelligence" 10; 
    lepouvoirdela visualisation, etc... ", "the power to visualize, etc... " 11. 
    </b> 
  <p>10) T.N.: Mercury-Hod's 72 Intelligences. See this volume's pages concerning 
    them.
  <p>11) T.N.: Because visualization falls under the activity of the Fire Element 
    and since the Serpent represents also that Element: See the Ouroboros, that 
    Serpent that bites its tail and that symbolizes the Universal Fire circling 
    the Space of the Creation.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 36, "un autre petit Cercle ou un Pentagramme", "another small Circle 
    or a Pentagrarn" 12; "pointe vers le hauC, "point upwards" 13.</b> 
  <p>12) T.N.: The phrase "Circle or Pentagrarn" is revelatory of a great Law. 
    Indeed, mathematically, a Circle is also a Pentagram, the one reflecting the 
    other, according to whether one considers, the Absolute (the Circle) or the 
    Created (the Pentagram); for a Circle comprises 5 times 72 degrees, the 5 
    points of this division uniting to form a Pentagram. The Number Five is also 
    the "Key" to understand "the rhythm of Time" or of the Cosmic Cycles.
  <p>13) T.N.: The Pentagram must be traced in the circle, one point headed towards 
    the East, facing which are performed the Rituals, the two opposite points 
    or bottom of the Pentagram, being on one side and the other of the West. The 
    Magus, standing in his Circle, and keeping himself in the exact middle of 
    the Pentagram, must see IN FRONT OF HIM, while he faces Eastwards, the Pentagram's 
    upper point.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 38, 1e monde mental, astral et physique", "the mental, astral and 
    physical world" 14; "Le Triangle doit &re construit pointe en hauC, "The triangle 
    must be constructed with the point up" 15. </b> 
  <p>14) T.N.: Not to be forgotten that the physical plane is but the densification 
    of the etheric plane and that Occultism considers that the physical body in 
    which the beings evolve towards consciousness is not a Principle, that is 
    to say that this state of fact does not fall under the Primordial Divine Plan...
  <p>15) T.N.: Point Eastwards and base near the Circle. 
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 39, "cet Etre ou cette Puissance ne doit jamais &re plus important 
    que le Triangle lui-m~me", "that Being or that Power must never be more important 
    than the Triangle itself'16. </b> 
  <p>16) T.N.: The Circle and the triangle, thus put in each other's presence, 
    do create a vibratory whole having two foci: The first is the Circle's Centre, 
    the second, the Centre of the Triangle. The presence of the Magus at the Circle's 
    middle location, gears the Centre's electro-magnetic force down; the Magus 
    attracts (magnetism) and propels (electricity) the Force or Entity evoked; 
    then, by reaction and in order to restore balance, the Triangle's Centre "activates 
    itself' by as much and allows the dense manifestation of the Force or entity; 
    in a word, the Magus provides a part of the electro-magnetism required for 
    the magical operation.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 40, "il reproduit la Parcelle Divine incorpor&eacute;e en lui", "he 
    reproduces the Divine Particle incorporated into him" 17. </b> 
  <p>17) T.N.: That is to say the Three higher Principles of the human being, 
    to wit, in the Oriental terminology: Atman, Buddhi and Buddhi-Manas, also 
    called Individual Higher Triad or simply veritable &quot;Individuality".
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 44, "ne peuvent apparaître que dans une ambiance rayonnant une pure 
    lumière blanche", "can appear but in an environment radiating a pure white 
    light 18. </b> 
  <p>18) T.N.: They "appear" but are not the Entity's actual presence for they 
    cannot cross our Solar System's "Ring that one does not cross". They can "project 
    themselves mentally" however, and they do so, in the operator's Spiritual 
    Self or Monad, a Self that transmits the vibration to the higher mental, then 
    to the lower mental and, thanks to the white light, they can shape a form, 
    an image of themselves which the operator then sees projected in the Triangle.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 49, "La Lumière spirituelle du Mage", "The spiritual Light of the 
    Magus" 19. </b> 
  <p>19) T.N.: His own Higher Triad's. For those who use Oriental references, 
    what is involved is Atma linked to Buddhi and to the Higher Manas.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 58, "au détriment à la fois du Mage et de la charge de la Baguette", 
    "to the detriment of both the Magus and the Wand's charge"20. </b> 
  <p>20) T.N.: Because the Wand is intimately linked to the operator's own energy 
    and [since] all that touches the latter is therefore reverberated on his owner. 
    Moreover, the initial charge is quasi -contaminated by another vibration, 
    not belonging in quality and in quantity with the first, which perverts the 
    instrument entirely; it empties it through "vampirism", or it pollutes it.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 62, "mais par le Mage lui-m~me", "but by the Magus himself&quot; 
    21. </b> 
  <p>21) T.N.: Through the Element composing the triple structure of the Magus 
    (ethericophysical, psychical and mental) and according to the plan or plans 
    of actions wished for.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 65, "qui sont impliquées dans notre monde physique", "that are involved 
    in our physical world"22; "Démonologie et qui n'obtiendraient jamais de résultats 
    sans son concours", "Demonology and who would never obtain any results without 
    its help23. </b> 
  <p>22) T.N.: This is why, among others, Esoteric Tradition asserts that Hell 
    is indeed situated on these planes of existence, the Earth being mainly concerned.
  <p>23) T.N.: Demonology: Knowledge of the Art of subduing the demoniacal hierarchies 
    to the Divine Program, in particular with a view to free the dense planes 
    (lower mental or Kama-Manas - "the mental filled with desires" -, lower astral 
    or lower Kama - "the maleficent desire" -, dense etheric plane where wallow 
    larvae, schemes, etc ... ) from their pernicious action and to thus help human 
    beings to leave their sphere of influence.<br>
    This practice is reserved to some High Adepts and it must therefore not be 
    confused with sorcery doings which indeed are a "collaboration" with those 
    destructive powers. It is brought into play (in a milder way) in the event 
    of Exorcism.<br>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 66, 'Vest qu'une épée mais plus courte", "is but a sword only shorter"24. 
    </b> 
  <p>24) T.N.: Dagger: A wide and short bladed sword in use from the XVth to the 
    XVIIIth century.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 68, "recours A un forgeron", "resort to a blacksmith"25. </b> 
  <p>25) T.N.: Or to a gunsmith.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 69, "un Hexagone", "an Hexagon"26. </b> 
  <p>26) T.N.: An Hexagone is a figure with points joined outwardly the one to 
    the other by a line, while an hexagram joins those same points following the 
    inner circuit of two intertwined triangles.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 71, "Les sorciers", "Sorcerers"27. </b> 
  <p>27) T.N.: In the usual sense: black magician, but also in the deeper sense: 
    Verily ignorant of the Universe's laws.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 74, "son propre sang pour certaines op6rations", 'Ns own blood for 
    certain operations"28. </b> 
  <p>28) T.N.: See what is said of blood in "Le Chemin de la Véritable Initiation 
    Magique", of the same author, page 40. What is involved is making with blood 
    a "witness", better than hair, some saliva or a simple photograph, to cause 
    the Elemental Hierarchies to work on oneself in order to purify the being's 
    structure and allow a better effulgence of the Akasha which that organic substance 
    (blood) carries excellently.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 76, 1e Pentacle de Salornon", "Solomon's Pentacle"29. </b> 
  <p>29) T.N.: An Hexagram or Six-pointed Star.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 78, "veau dont la naissance a 6t6 pr6matur6e", "calf whose birth 
    was premature"30. </b> 
  <p>30) T.N.: The "blank" parchment is so because it was not scraped multiple 
    times. Parchments used to be scraped so that one could write on them anew, 
    then scraped again, etc... After such a treatment, they were, called "palimpsests", 
    a word whose Greek etymology reveals to us that they were "scraped several 
    times". 
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 85, "une multiplicité de Sphères", "a multiplicity of Spheres"31, 
    "parfaitement mjitriser la sph&e materielle", "master the material sphere 
    perfectly"32. </b> 
  <p>31) T.N.: The word multiplicity translates a transcending reality well but 
    only few planes are revealed, having regard to the infinitude existing. That 
    Universal Immensity has been called in the East "Sahalokhadatu", the "Chiliocosmos" 
    of the Ancients, that "1000 World Universe".
  <p>32) T.N.: Here appears clearly the identity of the etheric and physical plane 
    for the mastery of the material plane is effected by the etheric.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 86, 1 - LA SPHERE ASTRALE DE LA TERRE", 1 - THE ASTRAL SPHERE OF 
    THE EARTH"33. </b> 
  <p>33) T.N.: What is involved is the astral plane linked to the Earth. But the 
    astral plane is of a vaster extent and each Planetary Sphere has a part of 
    itself linked to it; moreover; one generally says A Sphere "surrounding" the 
    Earth. Actually, that Sphere inter-penetrates the Earth even though a certain 
    effulgence into space allows justifying that word.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 87, "r&eacute;sider sur la m&ecirc;me subdivision du plan astraP&quot; 
    &quot;Reside on the same subdivision of the astral plane"34. </b> 
  <p>34) T.N.: Franz Bardon is speaking here of the higher subdivisions of the 
    astral plane, those which the relatively developed beings reached, for the 
    lower subdivisions, on the contrary, are rife with coarseness, with violence, 
    and with relentlessness in [yearning to] procure physical sensations, impossible 
    to satisfy ... ; they constitute precisely that inner state experienced as 
    "the Hell&quot; of diverse religions, the, Orient's Avichi.

    &quot;se voyant tr&eacute;s rapidement r6absorb6 par", "seeing himself very 
    rapidly reabsorbed by"38. </b> 
  <p>35) T.N.: The reproduction force, the physical body's pleasure instinct, 
    the emotional desire to possess others, the very idea of that necessity to 
    possess, etc ... So many very &quot;densifying&quot; energies which physical 
    nature sends over those in imprisons.
  <p>36) T.N.: What is involved is the human cycle or the way which human beings 
    follow, for non human beings, belonging to subtle Spheres, evolve, as to them, 
    under other rules.
  <p>37) T.N.: What is involved is the Higher Mental (Buddhi-Manas).
  <p>38) T.N.: By the very action of the energies face to face.
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><b>Page 89, "A celle de son propre ~tre", "to his own being's"39. </b> 
  <p>39) T.N.: Through veiling his own light, creating thus a protection for himself 
    and a means of communication with those who reside there without perturbating 
    them by his dazzle.

    "that the decedent's higher vehicles"42. </b> 
  <p>40) T.N.: They feed, in fact, their etheric body.
  <p>41) T.N.: Such a preservation should not be confused with that which prevails 
    sometimes in the body having belonged, on the contrary, to Saintly beings, 
    and even to Great Beings. In the latter case, the vital energy feeding the 
    corpse has another origin: it is provided by those who come venerate the Saint; 
    without realizing it, those who attend there give their energy themselves, 
    sometimes, account being taken of the extreme purity of the etheric body of 
    the deceased Saint, the latter decides, in agreement with the Divine Will, 
    to let his etheric body feed his physical body, the whole becoming an energetic 
    "battery" - charged by the Saint from the higher planes or by "Devas" (Angels) 
    apt to inundate mankind with a Higher Force, of Recovery, of Blessing, etc...
  <p>42) T.N.: That is to say, for this specific, and very peculiar case, the 
    psychical and mental bodies.

  <p><b>Page 91, "constituer le corps psychique d'un autre &ecirc;tre vivant,

  <p>43) T.N.: That means that the higher Principles (Monad and its Envelope, 
    "Buddhi&quot; as well as High-Mental), which constitute a Being's veritable 
    Individuality, no longer feed the astral body that has become "a corpse" decomposing 
    on that astral plane.

    verily, the density into which we are immersed is situated lower vibratorily 
    than "the density programmed by God&quot; (the genuine Malkhut; that is one 
    of the mysteries of the Fall... Malkhut is the Seventh Sphere - in excluding

  <p>48) T.N.: What is involved can also be an individual's Causal Body, his Inner

  <p>51) T.N.: The sound is a manifestation of the Fire Element. Its astral seat 
    is the Centre of the Throat which is ruled by the Akasha; now, the first expression 
    of the Akasha (also called "the Great Afflatus") is precisely the Fire Element; 
    the sound therefore (Fire) is indeed born of the Throat's Akasha. The fact 
    that an "image" arise forthwith is explained by the action of Fire, which 
    rises, mentalizes itself instantaneously (attracted actually by the mental 
    Fire) and is manifested as image; visualization, the creation, the picking 
    up of images, speech, etc... are all Fire's offsprings.
  <p>52) T.N.: It is the mental of the Magus that operated that translation: it 
    provides its content, loosely meant, it is true, for what is involved can 
    be a knowledge confined in him since other lives; this is why, if the Magus

    and radiates through the higher mental. Failing this, if that Principle is 
    in the state of "latency", no awareness of doing "evil" shall intervene. This

    The latter are actually Adepts, who guide the Pupil-Magus. It is this kind

    are born of those interactions and produce molecules, which constitute, on 
    that dense plane, the manifestation, of "chemical a nature", of the Initial

    from birth to birth until understanding that he must at last take "the Way 
    of Perfection", that which leads to Perfect Adeptness. Moreover, personality 
    and individuality should not be confused. The former is the whole of the bodies 
    woven in the lower planes: concrete, astral and etherico-physical mental; 
    that personality, in time, is dissolved. The latter, Individuality, is each 
    being's Only reality, its 7th, 6th and 5th Principles, the Atinan, Buddhi, 
    Higher Manas. That individuality merges while keeping Self-Awareness into 
    the Universal Consciousness (Alaya). There is therefore no "final annihilation" 
    as lets it be supposed an erroneous construction of the Texts but a merging 
    into Consciousness.

    can be picked up but by Tiphereth. Now Metatron has the power of crossing 
    that Chasm; this is why it is also called "the Mediator" to which refer the 
    other great Beings ruling Tiphereth, under a particular cycle: Raphael and

    That is why one must not believe that Perfect Adeptship is acquired within 
    a lifetime, unless one is, as Milarepa was, already on "the brink of the Chasm 
    of Ligh&quot;. The state here described is that which the Orient names a "Nirmanakaya", 
    of a Perfect Adept who keeps however the dense vehicles (no astral body which 
    he destroyed forever) - to help Mankind and approach it at will.
