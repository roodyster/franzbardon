  <blockquote> 
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
      never meant to say that spiritual experiences are not possible in eckankar, 
      since they are possible under any circumstances. However, mystical experiences 
      are not so common that we should be too gullible about reports. But don't 
      such experiences contain some proof ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People 
      have believed in the earth as being flat for thousands of years, because 
      such was their experience which as such was perfectly valid: it really did 
      appear to be flat. That experience even seemed to be common for most people 
      on earth without any connection to each other. The idea even worked for 
      thousands of years since people never traveled very far from their home.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But: 
      that experience didn't prove the flatness of earth. The earth has never 
      been a disc, not even "for them". That was just their view.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How 
      is it that eckists who have so much insight never see Virgin Mary, Krishna 
      or Cakrasamvara, only the LEM or some Wisdom temples ? Why does a Catholic 
      visionary see Mary but not the Red-Indian Gods? If they all actually existed 
      independently from the practioners view of the world, then we should be 
      able to "see" all of them on the inner just as easily as the others if we 
      wanted to.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Obviously 
      these experiences are expressions, a language of the psyche, projected outwardly 
      as experiences, and thus they cannot be used to prove or confirm any view 
      of the world, only to understand the workings of the psyche (which is the 
      true spiritual value of experiences).</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Someone 
      who really wants to know how things actually are must be aware that his 
      obscurations and limits of consciousness do not allow him to see things 
      as they really are. Therefore he cannot rely on his subjective view and 
      "experience" as the ultimate criterion for reality, but must always be extremely 
      critical of his own experiences.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      I scrutinize the reports of subjective experiences, especially "inner" experiences 
      by eckists, the usual reaction is that they say I discount what they "know" 
      through direct revelation, and that I am in no position to do so, most often 
      adding that I obviously haven't had the experiences.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      probably isn't wrong, however, to repeat at this point that I have in the 
      course of time had many of the experiences described in the works of eck. 
      But the main point here is that in such a scrutiny, I don't discount any 
      experience as such, but usually the conceptualization of it.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      you look at the reality of the stories rendered, they are not the experience, 
      but a) conceptual interpretations of b) memories of the c) conscious part 
      of an experiencing process as d) reflected in an unenlightened and therefore 
      unreliable mind.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
      course, that mind itself trust its "perceptions" completely, and therein 
      lies its illusion which has it wander on the wheel of life. In fact pure 
      experiencing without conceptualizing or past impressions, emotions and illusions 
      getting in between is an art which characterizes an extremely advanced spiritual 
      practicioner. And only when this "Freedom from the Known", as Krishnamurti 
      calls it, from the fogs of the past, has become chronical, so to speak, 
      24 hours a day, do we speak of full enlightenment, and only then can all 
      perceptions be relied upon 100%.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until 
      then, however, we should deal with our experiences with all the healthy 
      scepticism we can muster, regardless of our desire to give in to preconceived 
      notions in order to belong to a certain society of agreements and confirmations, 
      or even to confirm our vague ideas gathered during childhood.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a NAME="Experiencing and conceptualization"></a>Experiencing 
      and conceptualization</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      unreliability of defiled and conceptualized perceptions becomes apparent 
      even with the simplest cases, and it is strange how seemingly intelligent 
      people never think of questioning themselves in this respect.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's 
      look at such a simple example typical of naive theistic faiths: An eckists 
      says "I experience such a longing feeling for God, I know that he calls 
      my Soul, I have to walk the spiritual path". Of course, here we are not 
      even yet concerned with inner visions or anything like that. But even here, 
      people seem to give in all too easily to the conceptualizing impulse.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's 
      as if they just can't allow themselves to accept their feelings for what 
      they are, but neurotically have to give it a interpretative spin which makes 
      them appear in a highly noble light according to the ideology and society 
      they adore: how can they know that their longing is for a god when they 
      even don't know what they mean by god - let alone himself ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
      one probes further, the fact is that they usually haven't the slightest 
      clue what they are longing for, so they allow an authority (HI, EM) to interpret 
      it for them. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, 
      according to the teachings of eck, longing (which, no matter how deep, is 
      an emotion) is an "astral" phenomenon, something that ceases on the "causal 
      plane", long before one gets anywhere near those planes of experience where 
      the ideology would speak of "God".</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
      obviously, the longing itself cannot differentiate at all between God and 
      the causal plane, since it is supposedly transcended on either level. On 
      top of that, since god is attributed with omnispresence, then it makes little 
      sense to say that there is longing for him. In fact, whatever the longing, 
      the desire is for, one thing is for sure: it is not for god.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
      why are people in such a panic to quickly put their genuine experience of 
      a deep desire in such a conceptual drawer ? If they didn't and instead decided 
      to fully experience it with all their mindfulness and free of prejudice 
      they might discover highly interesting, even frightening things about the 
      desire, for example that it only arises under certain circumstances which 
      seem to resemble each other in a way. That it isn't independent of the body 
      (most desires even have vague locations in the body), that to look at it 
      without conceptual glasses has a taste of discontent, imbalance and even 
      suffering to it. That they remember the feeling from when they were alone 
      as a child ... I don't mean to put a different conceptualization on this 
      longing, and the above example is just one, although probably quite common, 
      possible result of prejudice-free observation.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, 
      it usually takes years to free oneself from the distortions in observing 
      an emotion, as it took decades to build them up. But the example gives a 
      model for the reasons why we are so bent on conceptualizing: precisely in 
      order not to be exposed to full experience ! Because what we would discover 
      is usually discontent in one form or another, the discontent inseperable 
      from the unenlightened state. The example of interpreting desire already 
      shows that we have reason to wonder what an eckist has really encountered 
      when he says "I have met the eck master [so and so] on the inner", because 
      we have (and most often he himself has) no idea how much conceptualizing 
      is a part of his report.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a NAME="Experiencing and deeper projections"></a>Experiencing 
      and deeper projections</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      tendency to conceptualize has an older brother who is much harder to see 
      through: the tendency to personalize and project which is so tied in with 
      our "perception" since the beginningless past that only very advanced practicioners 
      can cut through the illusion. The easiest cases of this tendency, with respect 
      to cutting through them, are when we see the man in the moon or a grinning 
      face where a tree branch is cut off. They get harder to untangle the more 
      primitive the projections are: we see attractivity in a certain type of 
      body form of the other sex, although it is really inside our conditioned 
      brains (or else all dogs and insects would also head for that person as 
      an object of lust) and against all reason we "perceive" a permanent individual 
      self simply because there is awareness, thought and a vague continuity of 
      structure called karma, DNA and a nervous system.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unwittingly 
      we have touched an important point here already: most of our "perceptions" 
      are an attempt of this illusory self to prove its own existence to itself 
      (**), and it appears that this is the root of passions and compulsory rebirth. 
      And in order to do so, all phenomena must also be given a personal status, 
      because if they were all selfless, how could they provide proof for our 
      own selfishness ? And so we think of deities where there is lightening and 
      thunder, "I" where there is a constantly changing personality, and even 
      when we happen to break out of this egocentric view for a moment and experience 
      an overwhelming sense of oneness, of interdependence and openess devoid 
      of a self (call it love if you must use this misused word), we have a cramplike 
      tendency to - even during the experience - cut ourselves off from it in 
      order to save our seperateness and perceive this as "god".</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">========</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[(**) 
      as an aside, there is an interesting theory mentioned in the Out-Of-Body 
      faq from the newsgroup, alt.out-of-body, that the "astral body" experienced 
      during an OOB adventure may simply be the personality's attempt to maintain 
      its self-representation as bodily existent when an energetic disorientation 
      makes our usual corporeal self-image hard to uphold. This would make sense 
      with respect to the curious disorders in the usual energy flows in the body 
      after such an OOBE.]</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">========</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      is largely by the same process that our neuronal discharges are seen as 
      dream worlds and people during excercises. It is like the blossoming of 
      a mental seed on the fertile ground of calmness. One can prove this to oneself, 
      since this tendency is more strongly seen the stronger the energy involved 
      with the experience is: simply raise your energy level and see how the projections 
      increase. Those of you who have experience with psychedelics (LSD, mushrooms) 
      will know what I am talking about. Actually, I unrecommend trying, as in 
      extreme cases this is how a psychosis can be released. Many psychotics put 
      personalized projections on everything: every sound ticks off another "inner 
      voice", every light reflex on a bottle another visitor invisible to others, 
      every thought another "inner command", and so they get overwhelmed with 
      millennia of impressions within one minute.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
      this point I highly recommend "Seduction of Madness" by Edward Podvoll, 
      a spiritual practicioner and psychiatrist who sheds more light on this process. 
      Here it is enough to say that prolonged attention on brain centers increases 
      the energy level in those areas. It is therefore no wonder that what comes 
      to our conscious awareness as so called "inner experiences" are (except 
      for enlightened experiencers) already highly overshadowed products of our 
      own subconscious machinery, high-speed interpretations of the actual experiencing 
      that takes place way below our conscious awareness, and unnoticed by our 
      defiled mind.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
      might discover something totally different if the defilements weren't there. 
      Maybe even the "world" simply is the reflection of our illusions on an even 
      deeper level ? At least it should make us suspicious to hear from masters 
      like Ramana Maharshi that there actually is no creation at all (and of course, 
      therefore no creator either). Let's not get into this aspect for now, though. 
      It is enough to say that not all teachings deceive their followers by suggesting 
      to them that their imaginations are definite reality.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Buddha 
      Dharma, for example clearly says that the true nature of things is totally 
      free from, empty of all our concepts and projections. In that sense all 
      phenomena, including one's own person is emptiness. Note that this is not 
      to become another concept, but that "emptiness" simply denotes the suchness 
      of reality devoid of projections and defilements (and not nihilism as some 
      would have it). So essentially a true spiritual path only aims at freeing 
      us from defilements and projections.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      this context, Paul Johnson's comment (from ARE) may be of interest: "A concept 
      from Shi`ism which I'm currently exploring in relation to Theosophy also 
      applies to Eckankar. In orthodox Shi`ite belief, the seventh Imam went into 
      occultation rather than dying, meaning he disappeared from sight and --since 
      there was no evidence of his death-- it was assumed that he continued to 
      live, waiting to remanifest at the end time. This left a vacuum in the Shi`ite 
      theology, which has been filled with a variety of strange developments, 
      most recently Khomeini's being acclaimed as the hidden Imam.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
      hundreds of years, people have been claiming to be in touch with the hidden 
      Imam through dreams, visions, etc. "This relates to Theosophy in that its 
      central Masters, Morya and Koot Hoomi, in fact (according to my research 
      anyhow) died in 1885 and 1887 respectively. Rather than admitting this, 
      Blavatsky allowed Theosophists to believe them still alive, just much less 
      directly connected with the TS than before. Result: a hundred years of Theosophical 
      history marked by competing claims to be in touch with the "occulted" Masters, 
      whose status as living or dead has been a source of great confusion.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"How 
      does this concept relate to Eck Masters? When Paul Twitchell used what Lane 
      calls "genealogical dissociation" to eradicate evidence of his links to 
      Sant Mat gurus, he set the stage for the same kind of occultation. Although 
      the originals for Sudar Singh et al. have indeed died, the Vairagi Masters 
      have lived on. What is most interesting about all this is the fact that 
      occultation somehow strengthens the hold on our imaginations that these 
      characters have. When we can confirm someone to be alive or dead, they seem 
      to be part of the phenomenal world just like the rest of us. But when they 
      are in occultation-- missing but not presumed dead-- this places them in 
      the world of numina where they radiate an otherworldly glow.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A 
      pop culture example is Elvis, and if we ask what psychological mechanisms 
      are involved in Elvis sightings, the answers may be relevant to the Imam, 
      Koot Hoomi, and the Eck Masters."</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
      while ago I listened to a show about contact with the dead. Some medial 
      talents claimed to have contact with the soul of a person whom all had believed 
      to be dead. All this seemed very impressing until all (including the medium) 
      learned for the first time that the person turned out to be still alive. 
      Other examples have been alluded to by Paul Johnson's last paragraph above: 
      During near death experiences, fans of Elvis Presley have had glorious visions 
      of "The King" in a tunnel of light. It must have been the deepest experience 
      these people can remember. An Indian woman who had spent her life in the 
      kitchen saw a&nbsp;<a NAME="glorious japati"></a>glorious japati (a form 
      of pan cake) in her near death vision. Do we deny any kind of transformational 
      value of such experiences ? No. But do we have to conclude that Elvis Presley 
      and the japati were self-existent spiritual masters ? There is more on this 
      subject in the chapters ylane+myst*.txt</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a NAME="Genuine visions"></a>Genuine 
      visions</font> </h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's 
      assume one has developed not only inner vision, but (much harder) the wisdom 
      to discriminate between appearances arising from macrocosmic karma ("real" 
      visions of "other" beings) and appearances arising from my personal microcosmic 
      karma (projections). How, if one is not fully enlightened oneself, is one 
      to know whether these beings are expressions of enlightenment ? Or whether 
      they are even trustworthy ? Shouldn't any disembodied being be able to impress 
      an earthling greatly without being reliable ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      we travel to another country on earth, or when we pick a lover we are less 
      naive. Strange enough, if we visit the "astral plane", we believe everyone, 
      even though it should be easy for that being to create a whole city of grand 
      illusions which fit our beliefs to feed on our life-force of attention. 
      Also, it seems as if someone sent out so called "elementals" which look 
      exactly like their creators imagine them to be, in this case like the pictures 
      of eck masters that eckankar issues. It is part of any magicians education, 
      and if one wants to know how it is done, one could take a look at the works 
      of the german 20th century magician <b>Franz Bardon</b>.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
      would be surprised if Twitchell hadn't been familiar with his works, or 
      at least with the techniques, maybe through the connection with Ron Hubbard 
      and possibly Aleister Crowley. It is typical for simple models of this sort 
      to appear in one's presence and simply be there and stare. More luxurious 
      models could probably show some features like giving simple messages and 
      act like a being with a mind.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 
      to most genuine spiritual traditions we should have a friendly attitude 
      towards a being that approaches us on the inner (very hard sometimes) but 
      not take notice of it, just let the experience pass like an itch. "The kingdom 
      of heaven lies within you" means you shouldn't mind any phenomena which 
      appear to the mind too much, regardless of whether it is physical or subtle. 
      In this respect it matters little whether you are attached to ESP, light 
      and sound experiences or pornography.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      is an integral part of all genuine spiritual traditions. Such experiences 
      have mostly been discounted in their importance as "temptation" (Christian 
      mystics, "When Jesus appears to you, spit him in the face" [Theresa of Avila]) 
      as mara/kama, or as makyo (Zen, "When you meet the Buddha on the way, kill 
      him"). The only good thing about these experiences is that they show that 
      your contemplation goes deeper. Other than that, they only serve to lead 
      astray.</font></p>

    <h3> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a NAME="The reliability of inner experience - An ecksample"></a>The 
      reliability of inner experience - An ecksample</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
      participant eckist on ARE, let's call her "divine" for now, gave all of 
      us on ARE an estimation of the reliability of most of what eckist would 
      call "inner experiences". Her example is interesting because the results 
      of her inner voyages could be tested. Usually, eckists instinctively keep 
      away from the realm of the testable because they have an intuitive feeling 
      (which they won't admit to themselves) that their experiences are mostly 
      self-projected.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Divine, 
      however, might have had some genuine experiences and thought herself to 
      be beyond the necessity of checking her experiences. This is what happened:</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 
      the months, divine's tone suggested she was some sort of universal witch, 
      a free yogini who used eckankar as a springboard while going much deeper. 
      And it took me many months on ARE to openly come to a different conclusion: 
      she went right into the classical trap of overestimating her spiritual achievement.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
      of the first things which made me supicious is the way she talked about 
      traditional meditation forms of another path (yidams). From her words, it 
      was apparent that she didn't really know what they are about, giving them 
      the samsaric status of thinking of themselves as "I" and feeling emotions 
      of hatred and desire - which only showed that she swallowed a complete misunderstanding 
      of what they represent. But it seemed that she liked them anyway, so I didn't 
      want to interfere too much with it.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      was frivolous, though, the way she reported her "inner meetings" with some 
      of them. She met the Green Tara (whom she considered her inner master even 
      more than "Wah Z") the way others run over to the super market to get butter. 
      These reports made me highly suspicious, since meeting a high bodhisattva 
      in sambogakaya form is said to be more like pulling the electricity supply 
      of NYC through one's bones.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tradition 
      very much differentiates visualizing sambogakaya forms and actually seeing 
      them. And one who sees them, usually doesn't talk about it so openly.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
      thing was her judgement of my person. I am very well able to say that I 
      am not the way divine described me in one article. Would someone who has 
      access to high sambogakaya bodhisattvas so frivolously misjudge another 
      person, and spread those errors on the internet? Of course, this made my 
      mind bolder for deciding on divine's spiritual stature: she was deluding 
      herself. She thought she had contact with enlightened energy, when she was 
      really talking to her own projections, interviewing her own prejudiced mind.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still 
      I wanted to test one of the "experiences" divine reported on ARE: A while 
      earlier, she seemed to be very fond of the idea that "master" means "image", 
      making a little etymological discourse (I never checked if there was anything 
      to that). Of course, the word "master" is western and didn't primarily develop 
      in a spiritual surrounding, so I tickled her by asking if this had any consequence 
      in spiritual matters, after all most masters were called guru, baghavan, 
      lama, roshi, not "master".</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then 
      came a fabulous story of her meeting the Green Tara where she got the idea 
      that "Gu" means light and "ru" means dark, so guru = Light+dark = image. 
      Voila ! Now if there had anything been to this, one couldn't have objected 
      to the way divine got there. But there isn't (see below).</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      is truly nonsensical. And in light of this we have to conclude: she was 
      using projected forms of yidams to get confirmation for her prejudices, 
      using them as mouthpieces for what she wanted to see. Unfortunately, what 
      made it harder for her too see through this, is the fact that she may have 
      had some success at other times, genuine intuitions, and also energetic 
      phenomena which seem to convincingly resemble those told by mystics and 
      yogis.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, 
      she seemed to have great talent for visualization, so that her projections 
      probably appeared extremely realistic. However, transrational intuition, 
      if it can be tested, turns out right. Else it is just prerational fantasy. 
      But it seemed she could not and did not want to distinguish between the 
      two: self-deception. This was truly in line with the tradition of Twitchell 
      and Klemp.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
      for some evidence of what "guru" means: The word is not at all mysterious, 
      it's an adjective and means "heavy" (with knowledge or wisdom or experience). 
      guru heavy guriyam heavier gurishta heaviest So the guru is a man heavy 
      with wisdom thus able to guide. That's the meaning of the word, neither 
      does gu mean light nor ru dark, nor is light and dark equivalent to image. 
      This construction (beside being far fetched) is so based on false information 
      that it renders divine's reliance on such experience for what it is. It 
      was also clear that she meant the reports seriously, since she repeated 
      to stress the experience as a great gift to us in a later post. I picked 
      divine above not to finish her off, but because her case is a typical example 
      of how eckists get confirmation for the rightness of their views and path 
      through untested "inner experiences", deceiving not only themselves, but 
      others as well, by telling them these fairy-tales.</font></p>

      with the LEM</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many 
      of us might remember the energies involved when we went for our first date, 
      when we had to talk in front of a lot of people or where overwhelmed by 
      the one-on-one encounter with a celebrity that we had a high estimation 
      for.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
      say that we felt emotions is probably a way of putting it mildly. From my 
      own experience, I have to say that such moments can spark off tremendous 
      processes which may very well have the dimension of the religious or magical.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
      others, I heard, this may be even stronger. In none of the cases, however, 
      did this mean at all that the encounter involved an extraordinarily advanced 
      or highly spiritual being. On the contrary: stories abound of how totally 
      unnoticed an advanced practicioner can walk among people, how they are unwilling 
      to allow charisma to influence people's minds. What do the impressing stories 
      mean then, that people spread about their meeting with EMs ? Obviously not 
      much. We would have to judge a so-called master's qualities when he feels 
      unobserved, totally without a public position, or when he is in danger of 
      losing all of his disciples. Gross's whining when he got thrown out, and 
      Klemp's dishonesty to keep members says a lot in this respect.</font></p>

      of "vairagis"</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stories 
      abound about meetings with EMs such as these from ARE: "A non-eck friend 
      of mine who had no previous experience or knowledge of Eckankar (except 
      what I had shared with her verbally from time to time) spontaneuosly (without 
      any promting from me) regognized my picture of Rebazar Tarz on my apartment 
      wall as someone who she had seen in her inner experiences." Strangely though 
      she is still a non-eck friend. Obvioulsy she is not too convinced of her 
      "recognition" herself. Of course, the eckist was because he wanted to be.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
      are plenty of those "recognition" cases, but the pictures are purposely 
      kept so vague (as in comic books) that anyone can easily "recognize" all 
      sorts of shapes as the men on the pictures. There's a lot of wanting to 
      be important and accepted involved in those acts of "recognition". Hundreds 
      of people "experience" things on the inner which fit in with the expectations 
      of others so they gain some recognition with them, especially if romantic 
      love is involved.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
      if someone has some ability in ESP (and all of us have it unconsciously, 
      especially when in love), he can dream of pictures another has in mind. 
      With some knowledge of the workings of the psyche, one would not be deceived 
      so easily. Isn't that what a master is there to teach us, rather than to 
      confirm and use our self-deception ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      Gampopa, the heart son personal student of the great Milarepa came to tell 
      his master of a great vision of all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas he had 
      had, Milarepa answered that he can also have a lot of visions by pressing 
      on his eyes hard enough. Then when he had a vision of terrible hells, Milarepa 
      just answered that Gampopa's meditation belt was sitting too tight.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Another 
      friend of mine had her daughter point to the picture of Rebazar Tarz and 
      report that she had seen him in her dreams on a number of occations." Children 
      stories such as these are a favorite among eckists. First of all, what does 
      it mean that a child reports to have seen a face in a dream that looked 
      like the extremely vague picture presented at eck events ? There are thousands 
      of ordinary people who look like the Tarzs given on the picture. Secondly, 
      aren't dreams sometimes prophetic and does that exclude children ? Why shouldn't 
      a child dream of a picture she would see a few days later ? Thirdly, see 
      the "elemental" possibility from above. Fourth, Children subconsciously 
      implement great parts of their parents personality into their own, as it 
      is a matter of survival. We wouldn't believe how much we have stored unconsciously 
      long before we are able to consciously reflect on what we experience.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
      the story, as given on ARE, that mother was obvioulsy already inclined to 
      embrace the teaching and was looking for evidence. Little children have 
      an almost supernatural detecting device for such parental desires and can 
      create "experiences" in no time. If the child needs recognition and feels 
      that it can attract her love by confirming what she wants to be true, very 
      often this is what the child does.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
      few years ago year I saw a young girl sitting on a tree branch talking to 
      her teddy bear for minutes and minutes, on and on until I left. Would one 
      call that "evidence" that the Teddy Bear is really a conscious being ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A 
      mother told of how her young daughter, with whom she had not yet discussed 
      the various eck masters except for the then-current Living ECK Master, came 
      to her one morning excited about a "dream" from the night before. She said 
      a man who called himself "Rubber Tires" identified himself to her and took 
      her somewhere. When the mother found a picture of Rebazar Tarz and showed 
      it to her daughter, she immediately recognized him (from an inside book 
      cover) as the man from the night before."</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First 
      of all, the possibilities from above, especially the "elemental" one, need 
      no repetition. Then, if one takes a closer look at what actually happened, 
      such cases will definitely appear in different light. I have heard many 
      such stories, and then when I inquired about the true situation, it was 
      all different.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides, 
      if it is published in the Eck Mata Journal, it may well be just another 
      one of the many stories published in there where reality is mixed with fiction. 
      Also, I remember myself in a certain phase having slightly made my experiences 
      more of a "proof" than they actually were in order to get confirmation from 
      the outside.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
      participant on ARE admitted that he was one of the people quoted in the 
      early discourses of eckankar who claimed to have experiences that serve 
      as serious evidence. It was only on ARE that he could set the story in a 
      more realistic light.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
      will likewise find experiences of "inner beings" full of glory telling other 
      people from other sects how evil the eck masters are. Each one is playing 
      his own game with himself in this context as long as one takes one's own 
      projections as proof.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
      is one reason Milarepa kept disappointing Gampopa in the example above. 
      A true master doesn't allow such self-deception in the long run. Most genuine 
      teachings agree that any visions and inner travels and so forth should not 
      be clung to or taken seriously as proof of anything. If a master doesn't 
      teach you this, he probably cannot lead you to liberation.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      David Rife adds on this question: "To be perfectly honest, I don't know. 
      There are several possibilities. [My person] pointed out a few already. 
      I would not discount thought transference as one possibility. I believe 
      at some level, we are all connected in mind and spirit. IMO, It is possible 
      that information can be passed between two or several people on an unconscious 
      level. This is just my opinion, I don't know what your beliefs are on this 
      topic.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
      do believe that if there were no pictures of Rebazar Tarz, everyone would 
      have a different description for him. I think the picture of Rebazar that 
      Eckankar circulates plays a substantial role in solidifying the image of 
      Tarz in everyone's mind. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
      first time I visited the Eck temple, I walked into the little room with 
      the pictures of the Eck masters. They immediately struck me as false. Maybe 
      it was the lack of detail, I don't know for sure. This disturbed me at the 
      time. I really wanted to believe in the masters. It was hard for me to accept 
      the evidence that they were cover names for other masters and not real people. 
      But in the end, my desire for truth was stronger than my desire for security, 
      at that moment, I saw through it all."</font></p>

    <h3> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a NAME="Visualization and the spiritual path"></a>Visualization 
      and the spiritual path</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
      participant on ARE mentioned: "If one hopes to make any inner progress on 
      the spiritual path, the discipline necessary to accomplish this task is 
      one that, to my thinking, can not contain any degree of imagination. After 
      all, imagination is part of the mind's arsenal against the soul." Whether 
      I agree with him or not, this follows even from the theology of eckankar. 
      But such consequential thinking has never kept eckists from the blissful 
      confusion of imagination and reality.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
      visualization is to serve its spiritual purpose, however, it has to be practiced 
      very precisely according to a genuine tradition. A visualization excercise 
      which has any spiritual value at all will not only remain with visualizing 
      an actual symbol of enlightenment derived from genuine visions by an enlightened 
      mind (not any self-created image) with the right attitude (the generation 
      phase of meditation) but also end with the completion phase of meditation 
      which really is the goal of the generation in the first place, and which 
      includes a complete dissolution of all the energy contained in the visualized 
      object as well as subject (!) into centerless light and openess, resting 
      in original nature of being.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Imagination 
      methods without completion stage tend to lead to increased attachement to 
      the practioner's own creations and crystallized thought forms which may 
      then have magical effect, misleading even the practioner himself who may 
      take his thought forms as proof of the dogma he follows.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      it comes to something as revolutionary as the actual practice of visualizing 
      meditation, however, I would discourage following hearsay. I'd advise following 
      a personal physical teacher who can transport a genuine tradition undistorted.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
      the path I follow, the highest (and most simple but very subtle) meditation 
      instructions are not given until after years of diligent and systematic 
      preparation, study of philosophy and purification.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Otherwise 
      one is almost certain to get stuck in some type of frozen pseudo-meditation 
      which is not of liberating quality. And after all, isn't liberation and 
      enlightenment what meditation is all about ? Are we even sure we are talking 
      about the same goals ? It is a pity, but one has to follow one genuine tradition 
      or another sooner or later. We cannot "gather the most useful" from each 
      one, just like the most modern parts of all streets to Rome together won't 
      lead us to Rome.</font></p>

    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
      have found, long before I came across any of the contrary evidence presented 
      that the outer organization of Eckankar is only the thinest, outer-most 
      veneer or public interface of a program that exists primarily on the inner."</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      Dave Rife said: "Are we supposed to believe that the inner is so important 
      that it is OK for the outer organization and leaders to go around lying 
      to everyone? If the outer is mostly lies, then what makes you so sure that 
      the inner is true?" [...] "They have effectively sold almost everyone the 
      notion that the inner is so important that the outer organization can do 
      as they please and not be held accountable for their actions. Please think 
      about this."</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      boils down to this: how much evidence does that eckist have of his ESP abilities 
      concerning even the common physical reality ? If he is not an exceptionally 
      accurate ESP-crack, what makes him think his "perceptions" of even much 
      subtler realities are accurate ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most 
      eckists never test their experiences in this light: it would be too frustrating. 
      "I find proof in my inner experiences" As long as we cannot exclude that 
      the experience arose from our own (storage) consciousness then it doesn't 
      prove much else than what our state of consciousness is. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Eckankar 
      is an individual path, so everyone must find out for oneself what is truth" 
      For something to qualify as an individual path, first it must qualify as 
      a path. If to give spiritual council to yourself, only with the help of 
      books and fellow students, is part of a path - without putting yourself 
      to decent tests under a recognized master, recognized by genuine traditions, 
      preferably more than one independently -, if a path endorses tales like 
      divine's and Morimitsu's as epitomy of spiritual experience, this may be 
      individual, but it hardly passes for "path". </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
      the only argument for the notion that eckankar is individual, is an indication 
      for it not being a genuine spiritual path. Other than that, what's individual 
      about eckankar ? Students hardly ever get to speak to their personal master 
      during their whole life, they only see him on stage along with an audience 
      of other thousands of people. They are all fed the same discourses.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
      all appearances, eckankar is one of the most unindividual mass-movements 
      on the planet. If one has a break-through in one's spiritual unfoldment, 
      one needs to be able to access one's master in physical form very soon. 
      It can make the difference between advancement and insanity.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      way eckankar handles the role of mastership, it is clear that all responsibility 
      involved with an individual one-to-one relationship between student and 
      master is rejected by the organization. Students are dealt with only in 
      a mass manner. An extremely irresponsible approach to something as explosive 
      as the psychic and spiritual realities.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
      inner master is with everyone individually" Since "inner master" is simply 
      an expression for our enlightened nature that we have to discover, there's 
      nothing about it that eckankar could lay a claim on. No argument for eckankar 
      being an individual path.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Some 
      eckists never had such experiences, as they are already beyond such phenomena" 
      If they were free from illusion then, that would be great. However, most 
      of these eckists are not. So it is hardly possible that they have already 
      gone beyond illusory phenomena, it's just that they restrict themselves 
      to everyday illusions.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      I remember those poor eckists I used to be a part of at our eck center, 
      this thing with "going beyond the phenomena" and paying attention more to 
      everyday life was - healthy as that advice may be - obviously an excuse 
      to console and pacify those who were starting to accumulate doubts because 
      nothing ever happened. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
      they are content because they think they are too progressed to experience 
      much, taking their little dreams for grand spiritual realizations.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
      think it's more than an excuse. 'First there is a mountain then there is 
      no mountain, then there is.' What I hear you saying is that the middle step 
      is important"</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shortly 
      before true insight, visions and "inner trips" are said to completely make 
      your view of the world change. However, the changed view is just as illusionary 
      as the old one, only more powerful and misleading. Zen speaks of "Makyo" 
      experiences, false enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      real art is how to stay on earth when the energy really gets going. Then 
      mountains are just mountains again. But the "mountain after" cannot be compared 
      to the "mountain before". One who sees the mountain after wouldn't look 
      for phenomena or be sad that he doesn't have them. So anyone who is looking 
      for guidance in eckankar (or anywhere) or even asks why he doesn't have 
      the experiences certainly does not see the "mountain after", he sees the 
      "mountain before".</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
      tell one who sees the "mountain before" that he already sees it "after" 
      is a severe spiritual disservice. Most eck leaders do this crime out of 
      ignorance. Besides, I don't think that the experience that eckankar aims 
      at is the "mountain after". They just want to go to the top of the mountain, 
      not knowing that after you go to the top, you'll have to come back down, 
      and nothing really changed. Gross is still full of lust, Twitchell was bitter, 
      Klemp is still full of tensions and so on.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"My 
      position is that one's inner experiences, as you seem to agree are not proof 
      of any conclusions that can be drawn on this physical plane. Even one who 
      is completely enlightened cannot offer his/her proof for someone else that 
      did not experience the same for themselves. By the same reasoning we cannot 
      reject another person's inner experience as obviously false or as "fiction" 
      without violating the same priciple."</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
      can oftentimes prove a statement wrong when at the same time it is impossible 
      in principle to prove that statement correct. Example: Statement: Mr X is 
      a Master according to his own definition of "master" and claims that a master 
      is absolutely honest to everyone. One can never give proof that Mr X is 
      a master in his own sense. Even if not lying would be the only criterion 
      for mastership, it would be impossible to prove that he had always been 
      honest with everyone ever since he claimed to be a master. It is principally 
      impossible.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
      it is enough to find just one case of dishonesty of Mr X to prove that he 
      does not fit into his own definition of mastership. There's hundreds of 
      examples of statements which cannot be proven right but can very well be 
      proven wrong, in principle. Also, it is true that absolute certainty gained 
      through experience uncommon to speaker and listener cannot be transferred. 
      That's why I tried to mainly rely on argumentation which is based on experience 
      accessible to all of us: documents, and statements by the persons at issue.</font></p>
