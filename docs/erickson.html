    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 
      Milton H. Erickson, MD and Ernest L. Rossi, PhD </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
      the past four years between the ages of 70 to 74, the senior author recounted 
      a number of personal factors and experiences that contributed to the development 
      of his interest, attitudes, and approaches to autohypnosis, trance, and 
      psychotherapy. Many of Erickson's earliest memories deal with the ways in 
      which his experience was different from others because of his constitutional 
      problems: He experienced an unusual form of color blindness, arrhythmia, 
      tone deafness, and dyslexia long before such conditions were well recognized 
      and diagnosed in the fairly primitive rural community in which he was reared. 
      As a child in elementary school, for example, he could never understand 
      why people did that yelling and screeching they called "singing". Although 
      he was different in ways that neither he nor others could understand, he 
      possessed an acutely probing intelligence that initiated him into a lifetime 
      of inquiry about the limitations and relativity of human perception and 
      behavior. When he visited his maternal grandmother for the first time at 
      the age of four, for example, the little Erickson was struck by the incredulity 
      in her voice as she said over and over to his mother, "It 's you Clara; 
      it's rally, rally you?! " The grandmother had never traveled further than 
      ten miles from her home and really did not have any conception of how people 
      close to her could exist beyond that radius. When her daughter married and 
      moved beyond it, she really never expected to see her again. Thus, by the 
      age of four, Erickson was already struck, in however dim and wordless a 
      manner, with the differences and limitations in people's perspectives. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
      experience with the limitations and rigidities in people's habitual frames 
      of reference occurred somewhat before the age of ten, when Erickson doubted 
      his grandfathers method of planting potatoes only during a certain phase 
      of the moon and always with the "eyes" up. The young lad was hurt and saddened 
      when his grandfather could not believe the facts when Erickson demonstrated 
      that his own potato patch planted at the "wrong" phase of the moon with 
      the "eyes" in all directions did just as well. From such early experiences 
      Erickson feels he developed a distaste for rigidities. These experiences 
      provided an orientation for some of his original approaches to psychotherapy 
      wherein he used shock and surprise to break through the habitual limitations 
      in patients' frames of reference to effect a rapid therapeutic reorganization 
      of their symptoms and life perspectives (Rossi, l973). Depotentiating a 
      subject's habitual mental sets and frames of references has been recently 
      conceptualized as an important stage in initiating trance experience (Erickson, 
      Rossi, and Rossi, l976).</font></p>

      one occasion Erickson was doing some exprimental work with K on stopped 
      vision (Erickson, l967), wherein she exprienced being in "the middle of

    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E: 
      I was in the backyard a year ago in the summertime. I was wondering what 
      far-out experiences I'd like to have. Yes I puzzled over that, I noticed 
      that I was sitting out in the middle of nowhere. I was an object in space. 
      <br>
      K: There you have it: the middle of nowhere. <br>
      E: I was just an object in space. Of all the buildings I couldn't see an 
      outline. I couldn't see the chair in which I was sitting; in fact, I couldn't 
      feel it. <br>
      R: You spontaneously experienced that vision? <br>
      E: It was the most far-out thing I could do! <br>
      R: That was the most far-out thing you could do? <br>
      E: You can't get more far-out than that! <br>
      R: It just happened to you as you were wondering about what you could do? 
      <br>
      E: Yes. <br>
      R: An unconscious responding? <br>
      E: And that was my unconscious' full response. <br>
      R: I see; you can't get more far-out than that. <br>
      E: What more far-out could happen? <br>
      K: You were just floating or just a nothingness? <br>
      E: I was just an object and all alone with me was an empty void. No buildings, 
      earth, stars, sun. <br>
      K: What emotions did you experience? Did you ------- curiosity or fear or 
      apprehension? <br>
      E: It was one of the most pleasing experiences. What is this? Tremendous 
      comfort. I knew that I was doing something far-out. And I was really doing 
      it! And what greater joy is there than doing what you want to do? Inside 
      the stars, the planets, the beaches. I couldn't feel the weight. I couldn't 
      feel the earth. No matter how much I pushed down my feet, I couldn't feel 
      anything. <br>
      R: That sounds like a spontaneous experience of nirvana or samadhi where 
      in Indian yogis say they experience "the void." You feel that is so? <br>
      E: Yes. The far-out experience of negating all reality-related stimuli. 
      <br>
      R: That's what the yogis train themselves to do. <br>
      E: Yes, just negating the stimuli from the reality objects. <br>
      K: You found that pleasurable? <br>
      E: I always find when I can do something, it's pleasurable. <br>

    <h3 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">INTRODUCTION</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      </font></h3>
      
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 
      a period of nearly a year much time was spent by Aldous Huxley and the author, 
      each planning separately for a joint inquiry into various states of psychological 
      awareness. Special inquiries, possible methods of experimental approach, 
      and investigations and various questions to be propounded were listed by 
      each of us in our respective loose-leaf notebooks. The purpose was to prepare 
      a general background for the proposed joint study, with this general background 
      reflecting the thinking of both of us uninfluenced by another. It was hoped 
      in this way to secure the widest possible coverage of ideas by such separate 
      outlines prepared from the markedly different backgrounds of understanding 
      that the two of us possessed.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      Early in 1950 we met in Huxley's home in Los Angeles, there to spend an 
      intensive day appraising the ideas recorded in our separate notebooks and 
      to engage in any experimental inquiries that seemed feasible. I was particularly 
      interested in Huxley's approach to psychological problems, his method of 
      thinking, and his own unique use of his unconscious mind, which we had discussed 
      only briefly sometime previously. Huxley was particularly interested in 
      hypnosis, and previous exceedingly brief work with him had demonstrated 
      his excellent competence as a deep somnambulistic subject.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      It was realized that this meeting would be a preliminary or pilot study, 
      and this was discussed by both of us. Hence we planned to make it as comprehensive 
      and inclusive as possible without undue emphasis upon completion of any 
      one particular item. Once the day's work had been evaluated, plans could 
      then be made for future meetings and specific studies. Additionally we each 
      had our individual purposes—Aldous having in mind future literary work, 
      while my interest related to future psychological experimentation in the 
      field of hypnosis. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      day's work began at 8:00 A.M. and remained uninterrupted until 6:00 P.M. 
      with some considerable review of our notebooks the next day to establish 
      their general agreement, to remove any lack of clarity of meaning caused 
      by the abbreviated notations we had entered into them during the previous 
      day's work, and to correct any oversights. On the whole we found that our 
      notebooks were reasonably in agreement, but that naturally certain of our 
      entries were reflective of our special interests and of the fact that each 
      of us had, by the nature of the situation, made separate notations bearing 
      upon each other. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Our plan was to leave these notebooks with Huxley, since his phenomenal 
      memory, often appearing to be total recall, and his superior literary ability 
      would permit a more satisfactory writing of a joint article based upon our 
      discussions and experimentations of that day's work. However, I did abstract 
      from my notebook certain pages bearing notations upon Huxley's behavior 
      at times when he, as an experimental subject, was unable to make comprehensive 
      notations on himself, although postexperimentally he could and did do so, 
      though less completely than I had. It was proposed that from these certain 
      special pages I was to endeavor to develop an article which could be incorporated 
      later in the longer study that Huxley was to write. Accordingly I abstracted 
      a certain number of pages, intending to secure still more at a later date. 
      These pages that I did remove Huxley rapidly copied into his own notebook 
      to be sure of the completeness of his data.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Unfortunately a California brushfire later destroyed Huxley's home, his 
      extensive library containing many rare volumes and manuscripts, besides 
      numerous other treasures to say nothing of the manuscripts upon which Huxley 
      was currently working as well as the respective notebooks of our special 
      joint study. As a result the entire subject matter of our project was dropped 
      as a topic too painful to discuss, but Huxley's recent death led to my perusal 
      of these relatively few pages I had abstracted from my notebook. Examination 
      of them suggested the possibility of presenting to the reader a small but 
      informative part of that day's work. In this regard the reader must bear 
      in mind that the quotations attributed to Huxley are not necessarily verbatim, 
      since his more extensive utterances were noted in abbreviated form. However, 
      in the essence of their meaning they are correct, and they are expressive 
      of Huxley as I knew him. It is also to be borne in mind that Huxley had 
      read my notations on the occasion of our joint study and had approved them.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <h3 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PROJECT 
      INITIATION</font></h3>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      project began with Huxley reviewing concepts and definitions of conscious 
      awareness, primarily his and in part those of others, followed by a discussion 
      with me of his understandings of hypnotic states of awareness. The purpose 
      was to insure that we were both in accord or clear in our divergences of 
      understanding, thus to make possible a more reliable inquiry into the subject 
      matter of our interest.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      There followed then a review in extensive detail of various of his psychedelic 
      experiences with mescaline, later to be recorded in his book (<i>The Doors 
      of Perception</i>. New York: Harper, 1954). </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      Huxley then proceeded with a detailed description of his very special practice 
      of what he, for want of a better and less awkward term which he had not 
      yet settled upon, called <b>"Deep Reflection."</b> He described this state 
      (the author's description is not complete, since there seemed to be no good 
      reason except interest for making full notations of his description) of 
      Deep Reflection as one marked by physical relaxation with bowed head and 
      closed eyes, <b>a profound, progressive, psychological withdrawal from externalities</b> 
      but without any actual loss of physical realities nor any amnesias or loss 
      of orientation, <b>a "setting aside" of everything not pertinent</b>, and 
      then a state of <b>complete mental absorption</b> in matters of interest 
      to him. Yet in that state of complete withdrawal and mental absorption Huxley 
      stated that he was free to pick up a fresh pencil to replace a dulled one, 
      to make notations on his thoughts "automatically", and to do all this without 
      a recognizable realization on his part of what physical act he was performing. 
      It was as if the physical act were "not an integral part of my thinking". 
      In no way did such physical activity seem to impinge upon, to slow, or to 
      impede "the train of thought so exclusively occupying my interest. It is 
      associated but completely peripheral activity.... I might say activity barely 
      contiguous to the periphery." To illustrate further Huxley cited an instance 
      of another type of physical activity. He recalled having been in a state 
      of Deep Reflection one day when his wife was shopping. He did not recall 
      what thoughts or ideas he was examining, but he did recall that, when his 
      wife returned that day, she had asked him if he had made a note of the special 
      message she had given him over the telephone. He had been bewildered by 
      her inquiry, could not recall anything about answering the telephone as 
      his wife asserted, but together they found the special message recorded 
      on a pad beside the telephone, which was placed within comfortable reaching 
      distance from the chair in which he liked to develop Deep Reflection. Both 
      he and his wife reached the conclusion that he had been in a state of Deep 
      Reflection at the time of the telephone call, had lifted the receiver, and 
      had said to her as usual, "I say there, hello," had listened to the message, 
      had recorded it, all without any subsequent recollections of the experience. 
      He recalled merely that he had been working on a manuscript that afternoon, 
      one that had been absorbing all of his interest. He explained that it was 
      quite common for him to initiate a day's work by entering a state of Deep 
      Reflection as a preliminary process of marshalling his thoughts and putting 
      into order the thinking that would enter into his writing later that day. 
      <br>
      As still another illustrative incident Huxley cited an occasion when his 
      wife returned home from a brief absence, found the door locked as was customary, 
      entered the house, and discovered in plain view a special delivery letter 
      on a hallway table reserved for mail, special messages, etc. She had found 
      Huxley sitting quietly in his special chair, obviously in a state of deep 
      thought. Later that day she had inquired about the time of arrival of the 
      special delivery letter, only to learn that he had obviously no recollection 
      of receiving any letter. Yet both knew that the mailman had undoubtedly 
      rung the doorbell, that Huxley had heard the bell, had interrupted whatever 
      he was doing, had gone to the door, opened it, received the letter, closed 
      the door, placed the letter in its proper place, and returned to the chair 
      where she had found him.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Both of these two special events had occurred fairly recently. He recalled 
      them only as incidents related to him by his wife but with no feeling that 
      those accounts constituted a description of actual meaningful physical behavior 
      on his part. So far as he knew, he could only deduce that he must have been 
      in a state of Deep Reflection when they occurred.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      His wife subsequently confirmed the assumption that his behavior had been 
      completely "automatic, like a machine moving precisely and accurately. It 
      is a delightful pleasure to see him get a book out of the bookcase, sit 
      down again, open the book slowly, pick up his reading glass, read a little, 
      and then lay the book and glass aside. Then some time later, maybe a few 
      days, he will notice the book and ask about it. The man just never remembers 
      what he does or what he thinks about when he sits in that chair. All of 
      a sudden you just find him in his study working very hard."</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      In other words, while in a state of Deep Reflection and seemingly <b>totally 
      withdrawn from external realities</b>, the integrity of the task being done 
      in that mental state was touched by external stimuli, but some peripheral 
      part of awareness made it possible for him to receive external stimuli, 
      to respond meaningfully to them but with no apparent recording of any memory 
      of either the stimulus or his meaningful and adequate response. Inquiry 
      of his wife later had disclosed that when she was at home, Aldous in a state 
      of Deep Reflection paid no attention to the telephone, which might be beside 
      him, or the doorbell. "He simply depends completely on me, but I can call 
      out to him that I'll be away and he never fails to hear the telephone or 
      the doorbell."</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Huxley explained that he believed he could develop a state of Deep Reflection 
      in about five minutes, but that in doing so he "simply cast aside all anchors" 
      of any type of awareness. Just what he meant and sensed he could not describe. 
      "It is a subjective experience quite" in which he apparently achieved a 
      state of "orderly mental arrangement" permitting an orderly free flowing 
      of his thoughts as he wrote. This was his final explanation. He had never 
      considered any analysis of exactly what his Deep Reflection was, nor did 
      he feel that he could analyze it, but he offered to attempt it as an experimental 
      investigation for the day. It was promptly learned that as he began to absorb 
      himself in his thoughts to achieve a state of Deep Reflection, he did indeed 
      <b>"cast off all anchors" </b>and appeared to be <b>completely out of touch 
      with everything</b>. On this attempt to experience subjectively and to remember 
      the processes of entering into Deep Reflection, he developed the state within 
      five minutes and emerged from it within two, as closely as I could determine. 
      His comment was, "I say, I'm deucedly sorry. I suddenly found myself all 
      prepared to work with nothing to do, and I realized I had better come out 
      of it." That was all the information he could offer. For the next attempt 
      a signal to be given by me was agreed upon as a signal for him to "come 
      out of it." A second attempt was made as easily as the first. Huxley sat 
      quietly for some minutes, and the agreed upon signal was given. Huxley's 
      account was, "I found myself just waiting for something. I did not know 
      what. It was just a 'something' that I seemed to feel would come in what 
      seemed to be a <b>timeless, spaceless void</b>. I say, that's the first 
      time I noted that feeling. Always I've had some thinking to do. But this 
      time I seemed to have no work in hand. I was just completely disinterested, 
      indifferent, just waiting for something, and then I felt a need to come 
      out of it. I say, did you give me the signal?" <br>
      Inquiry disclosed that he had no apparent memory of the stimulus being given. 
      He had had only the "feeling" that it was time to "come out of it".</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Several more repetitions yielded similar results. A sense of a timeless, 
      spaceless void, a placid, comfortable awaiting for an undefined "something," 
      and a comfortable need to return to ordinary conscious awareness constituted 
      the understandings achieved. Huxley summarized his findings briefly as "<b>a 
      total absence of everything</b> on the way there and on the way back and 
      an expected meaningless something for which one awaits in a state of Nirvana 
      since there is nothing more to do." He asserted his intention to make a 
      later intensive study of this practice he found so useful in his writing.

    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further 
      experiments were done after Huxley had explained that he could enter the 
      state of deep reflection with the simple undefined understanding that he 
      would respond to any "significant stimulus." Without informing him of my 
      intentions, I asked him to "arouse" (this term is my own) when three taps 
      of a pencil on a chair were given in close succession. He entered the sate 
      of reflection readily, and after a brief wait I tapped the table with a 
      pencil in varying fashions at distinct but irregular intervals. Thus I tapped 
      once, paused, then twice in rapid succession, paused, tapped once, paused, 
      tapped four times in rapid succession, paused, then five times in rapid 
      succession. Numerous variations were tried but with an avoidance of the 
      agreed upon signal. A chair was knocked over with a crash while four taps 
      were given. Not until the specified three taps were given did he make any 
      response. His arousal occurred slowly with almost an immediate response 
      to the signal. Huxley was questioned about his subjective experiences. He 
      explained simply that they had been the same as previously with one exception, 
      namely that several times he had a vague sensation that "something was coming," 
      but he knew not what. He had no awareness of what had been done. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further 
      experimentation was done in which he was asked to enter Deep Reflection 
      and to sense color, a prearranged signal for arousing being that of a handshake 
      of his right hand. He complied readily, and when I judged that he was fully 
      absorbed in his state of reflection, I shook his left hand vigorously then 
      followed this with a hard pinching of the back of both hands that left deep 
      fingernail markings. Huxley made no response to this physical stimulation, 
      although his eyes were watched for possible eyeball movements under the 
      lids, and his respiratory and pulse rates were checked for any changes. 
      However, after about a minute he slowly drew his arms back along the arms 
      of the chair where he had placed them before beginning his reflection state. 
      They moved slowly about an inch, and then all movement ceased. He was aroused 
      easily and comfortably at the designated signal. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>His 
      subjective report was simply, that he had "lost" himself in a "sea of color," 
      of "sensing," "feeling," "being" color, of being "quite utterly involved 
      in it with no identity of your own, you know." Then suddenly he had experienced 
      a process of losing that color in a "meaningless void," only to open his 
      eyes and to realize that he had "come out of it."</b> <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      remembered the agreed upon stimulus but did not recall if it had been given. 
      "I can only deduce it was given from the fact that I'm out of it," and indirect 
      questioning disclosed no memories of the other physical stimuli administered. 
      Neither was there an absent minded looking at nor robbing of the backs of 
      his hands. <br>
      This same procedure in relation to color was repeated but to it was added, 
      as he seemed to be reaching the state of deep reflection, a repeated, insistent 
      urging that upon arousal he discuss a certain book which was carefully placed 
      in full view. The results were comparable to the preceding findings. He 
      became "lost," . . . "quite utterly involved in it," . . . "one can sense 
      it but not describe it,". . . "I say, it's an utterly amazing, fascinating 
      state of finding yourself a pleasant part of an endless vista of color that 
      is soft and gentle and yielding and all absorbing. Utterly extraordinary, 
      most extraordinary." He had no recollection of my verbal insistences nor 
      of the other physical stimuli. He remembered the agreed upon signal but 
      did not know if it had been given. He found himself only in a position of 
      assuming that it had been given since he was again in a state of ordinary 
      awareness. The presence of the book meant nothing to him. One added statement 
      was that entering a state of Deep Reflection by absorbing himself in a sense 
      of color was in a fashion comparable to, but not identical with, his psychedelic 
      experiences. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      a final inquiry Huxley was asked to enter the reflection state for the purpose 
      of recalling the telephone call and the special delivery letter incidents. 
      His comment was that such a project should be "quite fruitful." Despite 
      repeated efforts he would "come out of it," explaining, "There I found myself 
      without anything to do, so I came out of it." His memories were limited 
      to the accounts given to him by his wife, and all details were associated 
      with her and not with any inner feelings of experience on his part. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
      final effort was made to discover whether or not Huxley could include another 
      person in his state of Deep Reflection. This idea interested him at once, 
      and it was suggested that he enter the reflection state to review some of 
      his psychedelic experiences. This he did in a most intriguing fashion. As 
      the reflection state developed, Huxley in an utterly detached dissociated 
      fashion began making fragmentary remarks, chiefly in the form of self addressed 
      comments. Thus he would say, making fragmentary notes with a pencil and 
      paper quickly supplied to him, "most extraordinary . . . I overlooked that. 
      . . How? . . . Strange I should have forgotten that [making a notation].... 
      fascinating how different in appears ... I must look...." <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      he aroused, he had a vague recollection of having reviewed a previous psychedelic 
      experience, but what he had experienced then or on the immediate occasion 
      he could not recall. Nor did he recall speaking aloud or making notations. 
      When shown these, he found that they were so poorly written that they could 
      not be read. I read mine to him without eliciting any memory traces. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
      repetition yielded similar results, with one exception. This was an amazed 
      expression of complete astonishment by Huxley suddenly declaring, "I say, 
      Milton, this is quite utterly amazing, most extraordinary. I use Deep Reflection 
      to summon my memories, to put into order all of my thinking, to explore 
      the range, the extent of my mental existence, but I do it solely to let 
      those realizations, the thinking, the understandings, the memories seep 
      into the work I'm planning to do without my conscious awareness of them. 
      Fascinating . . . never stopped to realize that my Deep Reflection always 
      preceded a period of intensive work wherein I was completely absorbed.... 
      I say, no wonder I have an amnesia. " <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, 
      when we were examining each other's notebooks, Huxley manifested intense 
      amazement and bewilderment at what I had recorded about the physical stimuli 
      for which he had no memory of any sort. He knew that he had gone into Deep 
      Reflection repeatedly at my request, had been both pleased and amazed at 
      his subjective feelings of being lost in an all absorbing sea of color, 
      had sensed a certain timelessness and spacelessness, and had experienced 
      a comfortable feeling of something meaningful about to happen. He reread 
      my notations repeatedly in an endeavor to develop some kind of a feeling 
      or at least a vague memory of subjective awareness of the various physical 
      stimuli I had given him. He also looked at the backs of his hands to see 
      the pinch marks, but they had vanished. His final comment was, ". . . extraordinary, 
      most extraordinary, I say, utterly fascinating." <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      we agreed that at least for the while further inquiry into Deep Reflection 
      might be postponed until later, Huxley declared again that his sudden realization 
      of how much he had used it and how little he knew about it made him resolve 
      to investigate much further into his Deep Reflection. The manner and means 
      by which he achieved it, how it constituted a form of preparation for absorbing 
      himself in his writing, and in what way it caused him to lose unnecessary 
      contact with reality were all problems of much interest to him. <br>
      Huxley then suggested that an investigation be made of hypnotic states of 
      awareness by employing him as a subject. He asked permission to be allowed 
      to interrupt his trance states at will for purposes of discussion. This 
      was in full accord with my own wishes. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      asked that first a light trance be induced, perhaps repeatedly, to permit 
      an exploration of his subjective experiences. Since he had briefly been 
      a somnambulistic subject previously, he was carefully assured that this 
      fact could serve to make him feel confident in arresting his trance states 
      at any level he wished. He did not recognize this as a simple direct hypnotic 
      suggestion. In reading my notebook later he was much amused at how easily 
      he had accepted an obvious suggestion without recognizing its character 
      at the time. <br>
      He found several repetitions of the light trance interesting but "too easily 
      conceptualized." It is, he explained, "A simple withdrawal of interest from 
      the outside to the inside." That is, one gives less and less attention to 
      externalities and directs more and more attention to inner subjective sensations. 
      Externalities become increasingly fainter and more obscure, inner subjective 
      feelings more satisfying until a state of balance exists. In this state 
      of balance he had the feeling that with motivation he could "reach out and 
      seize upon reality," that there is a definite retention of a grasp upon 
      external reality but with no motivation to deal with it. Neither did he 
      feel a desire to deepen the trance. No particular change in this state of 
      balance seemed necessary, and he noted that a feeling of contentment and 
      relaxation accompanied it. He wondered if others experienced the same subjective 
      reactions. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley 
      requested that the light trance be induced by a great variety of techniques, 
      some of them nonverbal. The results in each instance, Huxley felt strongly, 
      were dependent entirely upon his mental set. He found that he could accept 
      "drifting along" (my phrase) in a light trance, receptive of suggestions 
      involving primarily responses at a subjective level only. He found that 
      an effort to behave in direct relationship to the physical environment taxed 
      his efforts and made him desire either to arouse from the trance or to go 
      still deeper. He also on his own initiative set up his own problems to test 
      his trance states. Thus before entering the light trance he would privately 
      resolve to discuss a certain topic, relevant or irrelevant, with me at the 
      earliest possible time or even at a fairly remote time. In such instances 
      Huxley found such unexpressed desires deleterious to the maintenance of 
      the trance. Similarly any effort to include an item of reality not pertinent 
      to his sense of subjective satisfaction lessened the trance. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
      all times there persisted a "dim but ready" awareness that one could alter 
      the state of awareness at will. Huxley, like others with whom I have done 
      similar studies, felt an intense desire to explore his sense of subjective 
      comfort and satisfaction but immediately realized that this would lead to 
      a deeper trance state. <br>
      When Huxley was asked to formulate understandings of the means he could 
      employ by which he could avoid going into more than a light trance, he stated 
      that he did this by setting a given length of time during which he would 
      remain in a light trance. This had the effect of making him more strongly 
      aware that at any moment he could "reach out and seize external reality" 
      and that his sense of subjective comfort and ease decreased. Discussion 
      of this and repeated experimentation disclosed that carefully worded suggestions 
      serving to emphasize the availability of external reality and to enhance 
      subjective comfort could serve to deepen the trance, even though Huxley 
      was fully cognizant of what was being said and why. Similar results have 
      been obtained with other highly intelligent subjects. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      experimenting with medium deep trances Huxley, like other subjects with 
      whom I have worked, experienced much more difficulty in reacting to and 
      maintaining a fairly constant trance level. He found that he had a subjective 
      need to go deeper in the trance and an intellectual need to stay at the 
      medium level. The result was that he found himself repeatedly "reaching 
      out for awareness" of his environment, and this would initiate a light trance. 
      He would then direct his attention to subjective comfort and find himself 
      developing a deep trance. Finally, after repeated experiments, he was given 
      both posthypnotic and direct hypnotic suggestion to remain in a medium deep 
      trance. This he found he could do with very little concern. He described 
      the medium trance as primarily characterized by a most pleasing subjective 
      sense of comfort and a vague, dim, faulty awareness that there was an external 
      reality for which he felt a need for considerable motivation to be able 
      to examine it. However, if he attempted to examine even a single item of 
      reality for its intrinsic value, the trance would immediately become increasingly 
      lighter. On the other hand, when he examined an item of external reality 
      for subjective values—for example the soft comfort of the chair cushions 
      as contrasted to the intrinsic quiet of the room—the trance became deeper. 
      But both light and deep trances were characterized by a need to sense external 
      reality in some manner, not necessarily clearly but nevertheless to retain 
      some recognizable awareness of it. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
      both typos of trance experiments were carried out to discover what hypnotic 
      phenomena could be elicited in both light and medium deep trances. This 
      same experiment has been done with other good subjects, with subjects who 
      consistently developed only a light trance, and with those who consistently 
      did not seem to be able to go further than the medium trance. In all such 
      studies the findings were the same, the most important seeming to be the 
      need of light and medium deep hypnotic subjects to retain at least some 
      grasp upon external reality and to orient their trance state as a state 
      apart from external reality—but with the orientation to such reality, however 
      tenuous in character, sensed as available for immediate utilization by the 
      subject. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
      item which Huxley discovered by his own efforts, and of which I was fully 
      aware through work with other subjects, was that the phenomena of deep hypnosis 
      can be developed in both the light and the medium trances. Huxley, having 
      observed deep hypnosis, wondered about the possibility of developing hallucinatory 
      phenomena in the light trance. He attempted this by the measure of enjoying 
      his subjective state of physical comfort and adding to it an additional 
      subjective quality—namely, a pleasant gustatory sensation. He found it quite 
      easy to hallucinate vividly various taste sensations while wondering vaguely 
      what I would think if I knew what he were doing. He was not aware of his 
      increased swallowing when he did this. From gustatory sensations he branched 
      out to olfactory hallucinations both pleasant and unpleasant. He did not 
      realize the he betrayed this by the flaring of his nostrils. His thinking 
      at the time, so he subsequently explained, was that he had the "feeling" 
      that hallucinations of a completely "inner type of process"—that is, occurring 
      within the body itself—would be easier than those in which the hallucination 
      appeared to be external to the body. From olfactory hallucinations he progressed 
      to kinesthetic, proprioceptive, and finally tactile sensations. In the kinesthetic 
      hallucinatory sensation experience he hallucinated taking a long walk but 
      remained constantly aware that I was present in some vaguely sensed room. 
      Momentarily he would forget about me, and his hallucinated walking would 
      become most vivid. He recognized this as an indication of the momentary 
      development of a deeper trance state, which he felt obligated to remember 
      to report to me during the discussion after his arousal. He was not aware 
      of respiratory and pulse changes during the hallucinatory walk. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      he first tried for visual and auditory hallucinations, he found them much 
      more difficult, and the effort tended to lighten and to abolish his trance 
      state. He finally reasoned that if he could hallucinate rhythmical movements 
      of his body, he could then "attach" an auditory hallucination to this hallucinated 
      body sensation. The measure proved most successful, and again he caught 
      himself wondering if I could hear the music. His breathing rate changed, 
      and slight movements of his head were observed. From simple music he proceeded 
      to a hallucination of opera singing and then finally a mumbling of words 
      which eventually seemed to become my voice questioning him about Deep Reflection. 
      I could not recognize what was occurring. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
      this he proceeded to visual hallucinations. An attempt to open his eyes 
      nearly aroused him from his trance state. Thereafter he kept his eyes closed 
      for both light and medium deep trance activities. His first visual hallucination 
      was a vivid flooding of his mind with an intense sense of pastel colors 
      of changing hues and with a wavelike motion. He related this experience 
      to his Deep Reflection experiences with me and also to his previous psychedelic 
      experiences. He did not consider this experience sufficiently valid for 
      his purposes of the moment because he felt that vivid memories were playing 
      too large a part. Hence he deliberately decided to visualize a flower, but 
      the thought occurred to him that even as a sense of movement played a part 
      in auditory hallucinations, he might employ a similar measure to develop 
      a visual hallucination. At the moment, so he recalled after arousing from 
      the trance and while discussing his experience, he wondered if I had ever 
      built up hallucinations in my subjects by combining various sensory fields 
      of experience. I told him that that was a standard procedure for me. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      proceeded with this visual hallucination by "feeling" his head turn from 
      side to side and up and down to follow a barely visible, questionably visible, 
      rhythmically moving object. Very shortly the object became increasingly 
      more visible until he saw a giant rose, possibly three feet in diameter. 
      This he did not expect, and thus he was certain at once that it was not 
      a vivified memory but a satisfactory hallucination. With this realization 
      came the insight that he might very well add to the hallucination by adding 
      olfactory hallucinations of an intense, "unroselike," sickeningly sweet 
      odor. This effort was also most successful. After experimenting with various 
      hallucinations, Huxley aroused from his trance and discussed extensively 
      what he had accomplished. He was pleased to learn that his experimental 
      findings without any coaching or suggestions from me were in good accord 
      with planned experimental findings with other subjects. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      discussion raised the question of anaesthesia, amnesia, dissociation, depersonalization, 
      regression, time distortion, hypermnesia (an item difficult to test with 
      Huxley because of his phenomenal memory), and an exploration of past repressed 
      events. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
      these Huxley found that anaesthesia, amnesia, time distortion, and hypermnesia 
      were possible in the light trance. The other phenomena were conducive to 
      the development of a deep trance with any earnest effort to achieve them. 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      anaesthesia he developed in the light trance was most effective for selective 
      parts of the body. When generalized anaesthesia from the neck down was attempted, 
      Huxley found himself "slipping" into a deep trance. The amnesia, like the 
      anaesthesia, was effective when selective in character. Any effort to have 
      a total amnesia resulted in a progression toward a deep trance. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time 
      distortion was easily possible, and Huxley offered the statement that he 
      was not certain but that he felt strongly that he had long employed time 
      distortion in Deep Reflection, although his first formal introduction to 
      the concept had been through me. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hypermnesia, 
      so difficult to test because of his extreme capacity to recall past events, 
      was tested upon my suggestion by asking him in the light trance state to 
      state promptly upon request on what page of various of his books certain 
      paragraphs could be found. At the first request Huxley aroused from the 
      light trance and explained, "Really now, Milton, I can't do that. I can 
      with effort recite most of that book, but the page number for a paragraph 
      is not exactly cricket." Nevertheless he went back into a light trance, 
      the name of the volume was given, a few lines of a paragraph were read aloud 
      to him, whereupon he was to give the page number on which it appeared. He 
      succeeded in identifying better than 65 percent in an amazingly prompt fashion. 
      Upon awakening from the light trance, he was instructed to remain in the 
      state of conscious awareness and to execute the same task. To his immense 
      astonishment he found that, while the page number "flashed" into his mind 
      in the light trance state, in the waking state he had to follow a methodical 
      procedure of completing the paragraph mentally, beginning the next, then 
      turning back mentally to the preceding paragraph, and then "making a guess." 
      When restricted to the same length of time he had employed in the light 
      trance, he failed in each instance. When allowed to take whatever length 
      of time he wished, he could reach an accuracy of about 40 per cent, but 
      the books had to be ones more recently read than those used for the light 
      trance state. <br>
      Huxley then proceeded to duplicate in the medium trance all that he had 
      done in the light trance. He accomplished similar tasks much more easily 
      but constantly experienced a feeling of "slipping" into a deeper trance. 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley 
      and I discussed this hypnotic behavior of his at very considerable length, 
      with Huxley making most of the notations since only he could record his 
      own subjective experience in relation to the topics discussed. For this 
      reason the discussion here is limited. We then turned to the question of 
      deep hypnosis. Huxley developed easily a profound somnambulistic trance 
      in which he was completely disoriented spontaneously for time and place. 
      He was able to open his eyes but described his field of vision as being 
      a "well of light" which included me, the chair in which I sat, himself, 
      and his chair. He remarked at once upon the remarkable spontaneous restriction 
      of his vision and disclosed an awareness that, for some reason unknown to 
      him, he was obligated to "explain things" to me. Careful questioning disclosed 
      him to have an amnesia about what had been done previously, nor did he have 
      any awareness of our joint venture. His feeling that he must explain things 
      became a casual willingness as soon as he verbalized it. One of his first 
      statements was, "Really, you know, I can't understand my situation or why 
      you are here, wherover that may be, but I must explain things to you." He 
      was assured that I understood the situation and that I was interested in 
      receiving any explanation he wished to give me and told that I might make 
      requests of him. Most casually, indifferently he acceded, but it was obvious 
      that he was enjoying a state of physical comfort in a contented, passive 
      manner. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      answered questions simply and briefly, giving literally and precisely no 
      more and no less than the literal significance of the question implied. 
      In other words he showed the same precise literalness found in other subjects, 
      perhaps more so because of his knowledge of semantics. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      was asked, "What is to my right?" His answer was simply, "I don't know." 
      "Why?" "I haven't looked." "Will you do so?" "Yes." "Now!" "How far do you 
      want me to look?" This was not an unexpected inquiry since I have encountered 
      it innumerable times. Huxley was simply manifesting a characteristic phenomenon 
      of the deep somnambulistic trance in which visual awareness is restricted 
      in some inexplicable manner to those items pertinent to the trance situation. 
      For each chair, couch, footstool I wished him to see specific instructions 
      were required. As Huxley explained later, "I had to look around until gradually 
      it [the specified object] slowly came into view, not all at once, but slowly, 
      as if it were materializing. I really believe that I felt completely at 
      ease without a trace of wonderment as I watched things materialize. I accepted 
      everything as a matter of course. " Similar explanations have been received 
      from hundreds of subjects. Yet experience has taught me the importance of 
      my assumption of the role of a purely passive inquirer, one who asks a question 
      solely to receive an answer regardless of its content. An intonation of 
      interest in the meaning of the answer is likely to induce subjects to respond 
      as if they had been given instructions concerning what answer to give. In 
      therapeutic work I use intonations to influence more adequate personal responses 
      by the patient. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
      Huxley I tested this by enthusiastically asking, "What, tell me now, is 
      that which is just about 15 feet in front of you?" The correct answer should 
      have been, "A table." Instead, the answer received was "A table with a book 
      and a vase on it." Both the book and the vase were on the table but on the 
      far side of the table and hence more than 15 feet away. Later the same inquiry 
      was made in a casual, indifferent fashion, "Tell me now, what is that just 
      about 15 feet in front of you?" He replied, despite his previous answer, 
      "A table." "Anything else?" "Yes." "What else?" "A book." [This was nearer 
      to him than was the vase.] "Anything else?" "Yes." "Tell me now." "A vase." 
      "Anything else?" "Yes." "Tell me now." "A spot." "Anything else?" "No." 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      literalness and this peculiar restriction of awareness to those items of 
      reality constituting the precise hypnotic situation is highly definitive 
      of a satisfactory somnambulistic hypnotic trance. Along with the visual 
      restriction there is also an auditory restriction of such character that 
      sounds, even those originating between the operator and the subject, seem 
      to be totally outside the hypnotic situation. Since there was no assistant 
      present, this auditory restriction could not be tested. However, by means 
      of a black thread not visible to the eye, a book was toppled from the table 
      behind him against his back. Slowly, as if he had experienced an itch, Huxley 
      raised his hand and scratched his shoulder. There was no startle reaction. 
      This, too, is characteristic of the response made to many unexpected physical 
      stimuli. They are interpreted in terms of past body experience. Quite frequently 
      as a part of developing a deep somnambulistic trance subjects will concomitantly 
      develop a selective general anaesthesia for physical stimuli not constituting 
      a part of the hypnotic situation, physical stimuli in particular that do 
      not permit interpretation in terms of past experience. This could not be 
      tested in the situation with Huxley, since an assistant is necessary to 
      make adequate tests without distorting the hypnotic situation. One illustrative 
      measure I have used is to pass a threaded needle through the coat sleeve 
      while positioning the arms, and then having an assistant saw back and forth 
      on the thread from a place of concealment. Often a spontaneous anaesthesia 
      would keep the subject unaware of the stimulus. Various simple measures 
      are easily devised. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley 
      was then gently and indirectly awakened from the trance by the simple suggestion 
      that he adjust himself in his chair to resume the exact physical and mental 
      state he had had at the decision to discontinue until later any further 
      experimetal study of Deep Reflection. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley's 
      response was an immediate arousal, and he promptly stated that he was all 
      set to enter deep hypnosis. While this statement in itself indicated profound 
      posthypnotic amnesia, delaying tactics were employed in the guise of discussion 
      of what might possibly be done. In this way it became possible to mention 
      various items of his deep trance behavior. Such mention evoked no memories, 
      and Huxley's discussion of the paints raised showed no sophistication resulting 
      from his deep trance behavior. He was as uninformed about the details of 
      his deep trance behavior as he had been before the deep trance had been 
      induced. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
      followed more deep trances by Huxley in which, avoiding all personal significances, 
      he was asked to develop partial, selective, and total posthypnotic amnesias 
      (by partial is meant a part of the total experience, by selective amnesia 
      is meant an amnesia for selected, perhaps interrelated items of experience), 
      a recovery of the amnestic material, and a loss of the recovered material. 
      He also developed catalepsy, tested by "arranging" him comfortably in a 
      chair and then creating a situation constituting a direct command to rise 
      from the chair ("take the book on that table there and place it on the desk 
      over there and do it now"). By this means Huxley found himself inexplicably 
      unable to arise from the chair and unable to understand why this was so. 
      (The "comfortable arrangement" of his body had resulted in a positioning 
      that would have to be corrected before he could arise from the chair, and 
      no implied suggestions for such correction were to be found in the instructions 
      given. Hence he sat helplessly, unable to stand and unable to recognize 
      why. This same measure has been employed to demonstrate a saddle block anaesthesia 
      before medical groups. The subject in the deep trance is carefully positioned, 
      a casual conversation is then conducted, the subject is then placed in rapport 
      with another subject, who is asked to exchange seats with the first subject. 
      The second subject steps over only to stand helplessly while the first subject 
      discovers that she is (1) unable to move, and (2) that shortly the loss 
      of inability to stand results in a loss of orientation to the lower part 
      of her body and a resulting total anaesthesia without anaesthesia having 
      been mentioned even in the preliminary discussion of hypnosis. This unnoticed 
      use of catalepsy not recognized by the subject is a most effective measure 
      in deepening trance states. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley 
      was amazed at his loss of mobility and became even more so when he discovered 
      a loss of orientation to the lower part of his body, and he was most astonished 
      when I demonstrated for him the presence of a profound anaesthesia. He was 
      much at a loss to understand the entire sequence of events. He did not relate 
      the comfortable positioning of his body to the unobtrusively induced catalepsy 
      with its consequent anaesthesia. <br>
      He was aroused from the trance state with persistent catalepsy, anaesthesia, 
      and a total amnesia for all deep trance experiences. He spontaneously enlarged 
      the instruction to include all trance experiences, possibly because he did 
      not hear my instructions sufficiently clearly. Immediately he reoriented 
      himself to the time at which we had been working with Deep Reflection. He 
      was much at a loss to explain his immobile state, and he expressed curious 
      wonderment about what he had done in the Deep Reflection state, from which 
      he assumed he had just emerged, and what had led to such inexplicable manifestations 
      for the first time in all of his experience. He became greatly interested, 
      kept murmuring such comments as "most extraordinary" while he explored the 
      lower part of his body with his hands and eyes. He noted that he could tell 
      the position of his feet only with his eyes, that there was a profound immobility 
      from the waist down, and he discovered, while attempting futilely because 
      of the catalepsy to move his leg with his hands, that a state of anaesthesia 
      existed. This he tested variously, asking me to furnish him with various 
      things in order to make his test. For example he asked that ice be applied 
      to his bare ankle by me, since he could not bend sufficiently to do so. 
      Finally after much study he turned to me, remarking, "I say, you look cool 
      and most comfortable, while I am in a most extraordinary predicament. I 
      deduce that in some subtle way you have distracted and disturbed my sense 
      of body awareness. I say, is this state anything like hypnosis?' ' <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Restoration 
      of his memory delighted him, but he remained entirely at a loss concerning 
      the genesis of his catalepsy and his anaesthesia. He realized, however, 
      that some technique of communication had been employed to effect the results 
      achieved, but he did not succeed in the association of the positioning of 
      his body with the final results. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further 
      experimentation in the deep trance investigated visual, auditory, and other 
      types of ideosensory hallucinations. One of the measures employed was to 
      pantomime hearing a door open and then to appear to see someone entering 
      the room, to arise in courtesy, and to indicate a chair, then to turn to 
      Huxley to express the hope that he was comfortable. He replied that he was, 
      and he expressed surprise at his wife's unexpected return, since he had 
      expected her to be absent the entire day. (The chair I had indicated was 
      one I knew his wife liked to occupy.) He conversed with her and apparently 
      hallucinated replies. He was interrupted with the question of how he knew 
      that it was his wife and not a hypnotic hallucination. He examined the question 
      thoughtfully, then explained that I had not given him any suggestion to 
      hallucinate his wife, that I had been as much surprised by her arrival as 
      he had been, and that she was dressed as she had been just before her departure 
      and not as I had seen her earlier. Hence it was reasonable to assume that 
      she was a reality. After a brief, thoughtful pause he returned to his "conversation" 
      with her, apparently continuing to hallucinate replies. Finally I attracted 
      his attention and made a hand gesture suggestive of a disappearance toward 
      the chair in which he "saw" his wife. To his complete astonishment he saw 
      her slowly fade away. Then he turned to me and asked that I awaken him with 
      a full memory of the experience. This I did, and he discussed the experience 
      at some length, making many special notations in his notebook and elaborating 
      them with the answers to questions he put to me. He was amazed to discover 
      that when I asked him to awaken with a retention of the immobility and anaesthesia, 
      he thought he had awakened but that the trance state had, to him, unrecognizably 
      persisted. <br>
      He then urged further work on hypnotic hallucinatory experiences and a great 
      variety (positive and negative visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, 
      kinesthetic, temperature, hunger, satiety, fatigue, weakness, profound excited 
      expectation, etc.) were explored. He proved to be most competent in all 
      regards, and it was noted that his pulse rate would change as much as 20 
      points when he was asked to hallucinate the experience of mountain climbing 
      in a profound state of weariness. He volunteered in his discussion of these 
      varied experiences the information that while a negative hallucination could 
      be achieved readily in a deep trance, it would be most difficult in a light 
      or medium trance, because negative hallucinations were most destructive 
      of reality values, even those of the hypnotic situation. That is, with induced 
      negative hallucinations, he found that I was blurred in outline even though 
      he could develop a deep trance with a negative hallucination inherent in 
      that deep trance for all external reality except the realities of the hypnotic 
      situation, which would remain clear and well defined unless suggestions 
      to the contrary were offered. Subsequent work with other subjects confirmed 
      this finding by Huxley. I had not previously explored this matter of negative 
      hallucinations in light and medium trances. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
      this point Huxley recalled his page number identification in the lighter 
      trance states during the inquiry into hypermnesia, and he asked that he 
      be subjected to similar tests in deep hypnosis. Together we searched the 
      library shelves, finally selecting several books that Huxley was certain 
      he must have read many years previously but which he had not touched for 
      20 or more years. (One, apparently, he had never read; the other five he 
      had.) <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      a deep trance, with his eyes closed, Huxley listened intently as I opened 
      the book at random and read a half dozen lines from a selected paragraph. 
      For some, he identified the page number almost at once, and then he would 
      hallucinate the page and "read" it from the point where I had stopped. Additionally 
      he identified the occasion on which he read the book. Two of the books he 
      recalled consulting 15 years previously. Another two he found it difficult 
      to give the correct page number, and then only approximating the page number. 
      He could not hallucinate the printing and could only give little more than 
      a summary of the thought content; but this in essence was correct. He could 
      not identify when he had read them but was certain it was more than 25 years 
      previously. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley, 
      in the post trance discussion was most amazed by his performance as a memory 
      feat but commented upon the experience as primarily intellectual, with the 
      recovered memories lacking in any emotional significances of belonging to 
      him as a person. This led to a general discussion of hypnosis and Deep Reflection, 
      with a general feeling of inadequacy on Huxley's part concerning proper 
      conceptualization of his experiences for comparison of values. While Huxley 
      was most delighted with his hypnotic experiences for their interest and 
      the new understandings they offered him, he was also somewhat at a loss. 
      He felt that as a purely personal experience he derived certain unidentifiable 
      subjective values from Deep Reflection not actually obtainable from hypnosis, 
      which offered only a wealth of new points of view. Deep Reflection, he declared, 
      gave him certain inner enduring feelings that seemed to play some significant 
      part in his pattern of living. During this discussion he suddenly asked 
      if hypnosis could be employed to permit him to explore his psychedelic experiences. 
      His request was met, but upon arousal from the trance he expressed the feeling 
      that the hypnotic experience was quite different from a comparable "feeling 
      through" by means of Deep Reflection. He explained that the hypnotic exploration 
      did not give him an inner feeling—that is, a continuing subjective feeling—of 
      just being in the midst of his psychedelic experience, that there was an 
      ordered intellectual content paralleling the "feeling content," while Deep 
      Reflection established a profound emotional background of a stable character 
      upon which he could "consciously and effortlessly lay an intellectual display 
      of ideas" to which the reader would make full response. This discussion 
      Huxley brought to a close by the thoughtful comment that his brief intensive 
      experience with hypnosis had not yet begun to digest and that he could not 
      expect to offer an intelligent comment without much more thought. <br>
      He asked urgently that further deep hypnosis be done with him in which more 
      complex phenomena be induced to permit him to explore himself more adequately 
      as a person. After a rapid mental review of what had been done and what 
      might yet be done I decided upon the desirability of a deep trance state 
      with the possibility of a two stage dissociative regression—that is, of 
      the procedure of regressing him by dissociating him from a selected recent 
      area of his life experience so that he could view it as an onlooker from 
      the orientation of another relatively recent area of life experience. The 
      best way to do this, I felt, would be by a confusion technique (See "The 
      confusion technique in hypnosis" in Section 2 of this volume). This decision 
      to employ a confusion technique was influenced in large part by the author's 
      awareness of Huxley's unlimited intellectual capacity and curiosity, which 
      would aid greatly by leading Huxley to add to the confusion technique verbalizations 
      other possible elaborate meanings and significances and associations, thereby 
      actually supplementing in effect my own efforts. Unfortunately there was 
      no tape recorder present to preserve the details of the actual suggestions, 
      which were to the effect that Huxley go ever deeper and deeper into a trance 
      until "the depth was a part and apart" from him, that before him would appear 
      in "utter clarity, in living reality, in impossible actuality, that which 
      once was, but which now in the depths of the trance, will, in bewildering 
      confrontation challenge all of your memories and understandings." This was 
      a purposely vague yet permissively comprehensive suggestion, and I simply 
      relied upon Huxley's intelligence to elaborate it with an extensive meaningfulness 
      for himself which I could not even attempt to guess. There were of course 
      other suggestions, but they centered in effect upon the suggestion enclosed 
      in the quotation above. What I had in mind was not a defined situation but 
      a setting of the stage so that Huxley himself would be led to define the 
      task. I did not even attempt to speculate upon what my suggestions might 
      mean to Huxley. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      became obvious that Huxley was making an intensive hypnotic response during 
      the prolonged, repetitious suggestions I was offering, when suddenly he 
      raised his hand and said rather loudly and most urgently, "I say, Milton, 
      do you mind hushing up there. This is most extraordinarily interesting down 
      here, and your constant talking is frightfully distracting and annoying." 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
      more than two hours Huxley sat with his eyes open, gazing intently before 
      him. The play of expression on his face was most rapid and bewildering. 
      His heart rate and respiratory rate were observed to change suddenly and 
      inexplicably and repeatedly at irregular intervals. Each time that the author 
      attempted to speak to him, Huxley would raise his hand, perhaps lift his 
      head, and speak as if the author were at some height above him, and frequently 
      he would annoyedly request silence. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
      well over two hours he suddenly looked up toward the ceiling and remarked 
      with puzzled emphasis, "I say, Milton, this is an extraordinary contretemps. 
      We don't know you. You do not belong here. You are sitting on the edge of 
      a ravine watching both of us, and neither of us knows which one is talking 
      to you; and we are in the vestibule looking at each other with most extraordinary 
      interest. We know that you are someone who can determine our identity, and 
      most extraordinarily we are both sure we know it and that the other is not 
      really so, but merely a mental image of the past or of the future. But you 
      must resolve it despite time and distances and even though we do not know 
      you. I say, this is an extraordinarily fascinating predicament: Am I he 
      or is he me? Come, Milton, whoever you are." There were other similar remarks 
      of comparable meaning which could not be recorded, and Huxley's tone of 
      voice suddenly became most urgent. The whole situation was most confusing 
      to me, but temporal and other types of dissociation seemed to be definitely 
      involved in the situation. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wonderingly, 
      but with outward calm, I undertook to arouse Huxley from the trance state 
      by accepting the partial clues given and by saying in essence. "Wherover 
      you are, whatever you are doing, listen closely to what is being said and 
      slowly, gradually, comfortably begin to act upon it. Feel rested and comfortable, 
      feel a need to establish an increasing contact with my voice, with me with 
      the situation I represent, a need of returning to matters in hand with me 
      not so long ago, in the not so long ago belonging to me, and leave behind 
      but AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST practically everything of importance, KNOWING 
      BUT NOT KNOWING that it is AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. And now, let us see, 
      that's right, you are sitting there, wide awake, rested, comfortable, and 
      ready for discussion of what little there is." <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley 
      aroused, rubbed his eyes, and remarked, "I have a most extraordinary feeling 
      that I have been in a profound trance, but it has been a most sterile experience. 
      I recall you suggesting that I go deeper in a trance, and I felt myself 
      to be most compliant, and though I feel much time has elapsed, I truly believe 
      a state of Deep Reflection would have been more fruitful." <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
      he did not specifically ask the time, a desultory conversation was conducted 
      in which Huxley compared the definite but vague appreciation of external 
      realities of the light trance with the more definitely decreased awareness 
      of externalities in the medium trance, which is accompanied by a peculiar 
      sense of minor comfort that those external realities can become secure actualities 
      at any given moment. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      was then asked about realities in the deep trance from which he had just 
      recently aroused. He replied thoughtfully that he could recall vaguely feeling 
      that he was developing a deep trance, but no memories came to mind associated 
      with it. After some discussion of hypnotic amnesia and the possibility that 
      he might be manifesting such a phenomenon, he laughed with amusement and 
      stated that such a topic would be most intriguing to discuss. After still 
      further desultory conversation he was asked a propos of nothing, "In what 
      vestibule would you place that chair?" (indicating a nearby armchair.) His 
      reply was remarkable. "Really, Milton, that is a most extraordinary question. 
      Frightfully so! It is quite without meaning, but that word 'vestibule' has 
      a strange feeling of immense, anxious warmth about it. Most extraordinarily 
      fascinating!" He lapsed into a puzzled thought for some minutes and finally 
      stated that if there were any significance, it was undoubtedly some fleeting 
      esoteric association. After further casual conversation I remarked, "As 
      for the edge where I was sitting, I wonder how deep the ravine was." To 
      this Huxley replied, "Really Milton, you can be most frightfully cryptic. 
      Those words 'vestibule,' 'edge,' 'ravine' have an extraordinary effect upon 
      me. It is most indescribable. Let me see if I can associate some meaning 
      with them." For nearly 15 minutes Huxley struggled vainly to secure some 
      meaningful associations with those words, now and then stating that my apparently 
      purposive but unrevealing use of them constituted a full assurance that 
      there was a meaningful significance which should be apparent to him. Finally 
      he disclosed with elation, "I have it now. Most extraordinary how it escaped 
      me. I'm fully aware that you had me in a trance, and unquestionably those 
      words had something to do with the deep trance which seemed to be so sterile 
      to me. I wonder if I can recover my associations. " <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
      about 20 minutes of silent, obviously intense thought on his part Huxley 
      remarked, "If those words do have a significance, I can truly say that I 
      have a most profound hypnotic amnesia. I have attempted Deep Reflection, 
      but I have found my thoughts centering around my mescaline experiences. 
      It was indeed difficult to tear myself away from those thoughts. I had a 
      feeling that I was employing them to preserve my amnesia. Shall we go on 
      for another half hour on other matters to see if there is any spontaneous 
      recall in association with 'vestibule,' 'edge', and 'ravine?' <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Various 
      topics were discussed until finally Huxley said, "It is a most extraordinary 
      feeling of meaningful warmth those words have for me, but I am utterly, 
      I might say frightfully, helpless. I suppose I will have to depend upon 
      you for something, whatever that may be. It's extraordinary, most extraordinary." 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      comment I deliberately bypassed, but during the ensuing conversation Huxley 
      was observed to have a most thoughtful, puzzled expression on his face, 
      though he made no effort to press me for assistance. After some time I commented 
      with quiet emphasis, "Well, perhaps now matters will become available. " 
      From his lounging, comfortable position in his chair Huxley straightened 
      up in a startled amazed fashion and then poured forth a torrent of words 
      too rapid to record except for occasional notes. <br>
      In essence his account was that the word "available" had the effect of drawing 
      back an amnestic curtain, laying bare a most astonishing subjective experience 
      that had miraculously been "wiped out" by the words "leave behind" and had 
      been recovered in toto by virtue of the cue words "become available." <br>
      He explained that he now realized that he had developed a "deep trance," 
      a psychological state far different from his state of Deep Reflection, that 
      in Deep Reflection there was an attenuated but unconcerned and unimportant 
      awareness of external reality, a feeling of being in a known sensed state 
      of subjective awareness, of a feeling of control and a desire to utilize 
      capabilities and in which past memories, learnings, and experiences flowed 
      freely and easily. Along with this flow there would be a continuing sense 
      in the self that these memories, learnings, experiences, and understandings, 
      however vivid, were no more than just such an orderly, meaningful alignment 
      of psychological experiences out of which to form a foundation for a profound, 
      pleasing, subjective, emotional state from which would flow comprehensive 
      understandings to be utilized immediately and with little conscious effort. 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      deep trance state, he asserted, he now knew to be another and entirely different 
      category of experience. External reality could enter, but it acquired a 
      new kind of subjective reality, a special reality of a new and different 
      significance entirely. For example, while I had been included in part in 
      his deep trance state, it was not as a specific person with a specific identity. 
      Instead I was known only as someone whom he (Huxley) knew in some vague 
      and unimportant and completely unidentified relationship. <br>
      Aside from my "reality" there existed the type of reality that one encounters 
      in vivid dreams, a reality that one does not question. Instead one accepts 
      such reality completely without intellectual questioning, and there are 
      no conflicting contrasts nor judgmental comparisons nor contradictions, 
      so that whatever is subjectively experienced is unquestioningly accepted 
      as both subjectively and objectively genuine and in keeping with all else. 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      his deep trance Huxley found himself in a deep, wide ravine, high up on 
      the steep side of which, on the very edge, I sat, identifiable only by name 
      and as annoyingly verbose. Before him in a wide expanse of soft, dry sand 
      was a nude infant lying on its stomach. Acceptingly, unquestioning of its 
      actuality, Huxley gazed at the infant, vastly curious about its behavior, 
      vastly intent on trying to understand its flailing movements with its hands 
      and the creeping movements of its legs. To his amazement he felt himself 
      experiencing a vague, curious sense of wonderment as if he himself were 
      the infant and looking at the soft sand and trying to understand what it 
      was. <br>
      As he watched, he became annoyed with me since I was apparently trying to 
      talk to him, and he experienced a wave of impatience and requested that 
      I be silent. He turned back and noted that the infant was growing before 
      his eyes, was creeping, sitting, standing, toddling, walking, playing, talking. 
      In utter fascination he watched this growing child, sensed its subjective 
      experiences of learning, of wanting, of feeling. He followed it in distorted 
      time through a multitude of experiences as it passed from infancy to childhood 
      to schooldays to early youth to teenage. He watched the child's physical 
      development, sensed its physical and subjective mental experiences, sympathized 
      with it, empathized with it, rejoiced with it, thought and wondered and 
      learned with it. He felt as one with it, as if it were he himself, and he 
      continued to watch it until finally he realized that he had watched that 
      infant grow to the maturity of 23 years. He stepped closer to see what the 
      young man was looking at, and suddenly realized that the young man was Aldous 
      Huxley himself, and that this Aldous Huxley was looking at another Aldous 
      Huxley, obviously in his early 50's, just across the vestibule in which 
      they both were standing; and that he, aged 52, was looking at himself, Aldous, 
      aged 23. Then Aldous aged 23 and Aldous aged 52 apparently realized simultaneously 
      that they were looking at each other, and the curious questions at once 
      arose in the mind of each of them. For one the question was, "Is that my 
      idea of what I'll be like when I am 52?" and, "Is that really the way I 
      appeared when I was 23?" Each was aware of the question in the other's mind. 
      Each found the question of "extraordinarily fascinating interest," and each 
      tried to determine which was the "actual reality" and which was the "mere 
      subjective experience outwardly projected in hallucinatory form." <br>
      To each the past 23 years was an open book, all memories and events were 
      clear, and they recognized that they shared those memories in common, and 
      to each only wondering speculation offered a possible explanation of any 
      of the years between 23 and 52. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
      looked across the vestibule (this "vestibule" was not defined) and up at 
      the edge of the ravine where I was sitting. Both knew that that person sitting 
      there had some undefined significance, was named Milton, and could be spoken 
      to by both. The thought came to both, could he hear both of them, but the 
      test failed because they found that they spoke simultaneously, nor could 
      they speak separately. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slowly, 
      thoughtfully, they studied each other. One had to be real. One had to be 
      a memory image or a projection of a self image. Should not Aldous aged 52 
      have all the memories of the years from 23 to 52? But if he did, how could 
      he then see Aldous aged 23 without the shadings and colorations of the years 
      that had passed since that youthful age? If he were to view Aldous aged 
      23 clearly, he would have to blot out all subsequent memories in order to 
      see that youthful Aldous clearly and as he then was. But if he were actually 
      Aldous aged 23, why could he not speculatively fabricate memories for the 
      years between 23 and 52 instead of merely seeing Aldous as 52 and nothing 
      mole? What manner of psychological blocking could exist to effect this peculiar 
      state of affairs? Each found himself fully cognizant of the thinking and 
      reasoning of the "other." Each doubted "the reality of the other," and each 
      found reasonable explanations for such contrasting subjective experiences. 
      The questions arose repeatedly, by what measure could the truth be established, 
      and how did that unidentifiable person possessing only a name sitting on 
      the edge of a ravine on the other side of the vestibule fit into the total 
      situation? Could that vague person have an answer? Why not call to him and 
      see? <br>
      With much pleasure and interest Huxley detailed his total subjective experience, 
      speculating upon the years of time distortion experienced and the memory 
      blockages creating the insoluble problem of actual identity. <br>
      Finally, experimentally, the author remarked casually, "Of course, all that 
      could be left behind to become AVAlLABLE at some later time." <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immediately 
      there occurred a reestablishment of the original posthypnotic amnesia. Efforts 
      were made to disrupt this reinduced hypnotic amnesia by veiled remarks, 
      by frank, open statements, by a narration of what had occurred. Huxley found 
      my narrative statements about an infant on the sand, a deep ravine, a vestibule 
      "curiously interesting," simply cryptic remarks for which Huxley judged 
      I had a purpose. But they were not evocative of anything more. Each statement 
      I made was in itself actually uninformative and intended only to arouse 
      associations. Yet no results were forthcoming until again the word "AVAlLABLE" 
      resulted in the same effect as previously. The whole account was related 
      by Huxley a second time but without his realization that he was repeating 
      his account. Appropriate suggestions when he had finished his second narration 
      resulted in a full recollection of his first account. His reaction, after 
      his immediate astonishment, was to compare the two accounts item by item. 
      Their identity amazed him, and he noted only minor changes in the order 
      of narration and the choice of words. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, 
      as before, a posthypnotic amnesia was induced, and a third recollection 
      was then elicited, followed by an induced realization by Huxley that this 
      was his third recollection. <br>
      Extensive, detailed notations were made of the whole sequence of events, 
      and comparisons were made of the individual notations, with interspersed 
      comments regarding significances. The many items were systematically discussed 
      for their meanings, and brief trances were induced to vivify various items. 
      However, only a relatively few notations were made by me of the content 
      of Huxley's experience, since he would properly be the one to develop them 
      fully. My notations concerned primarily the sequence of events and a fairly 
      good summary of the total development. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      discussion was continued until preparations for scheduled activities for 
      that evening intervened, but not before an agreement on a subsequent preparation 
      of the material for publication. Huxley planned to use both Deep Reflection 
      and additional self induced trances to aid in writing the article, but the 
      unfortunate holocaust precluded this.</font></p>
    <hr>
      <h3 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CONCLUDING 
        REMARKS</font></h3>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      is unfortunate that the above account is only a fragment of an extensive 
      inquiry into the nature of various states of consciousness. <b>Huxley's 
      state of Deep Reflection did not appear to be hypnotic in character. Instead 
      it seemed to be a state of utterly intense concentration with much dissociation 
      from external realities but with a full capacity to respond with varying 
      degrees of readiness to externalities.</b> It was entirely a personal experience 
      serving apparently as an unrecognized foundation for conscious work activity 
      enabling him to utilize freely all that had passed through his mind in Deep 
      Reflection. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His 
      hypnotic behavior was in full accord with hypnotic behavior elicited from 
      other subjects. He was capable of all the phenomena of the deep trance and 
      could respond readily to posthypnotic suggestions and to exceedingly minimal 
      cues. He was emphatic in declaring that the hypnotic state was quite different 
      from the Deep Reflection state. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
      some comparison may be made with dream activity, and certainly the ready 
      inclusion of the "vestibule" and the "ravine" in the same subjective situation 
      is suggestive of dreamlike activity, such peculiar inclusions are somewhat 
      frequently found as a spontaneous development of profound hypnotic ideosensory 
      activity in highly intellectual subjects. His somnambulistic behavior, his 
      open eyes, his responsiveness to me, his extensive posthypnotic behavior 
      all indicate that hypnosis was unquestionably definitive of the total situation 
      in that specific situation. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley's 
      remarkable development of a dissociated state, even bearing in mind his 
      original request for a permissive technique, to view hypnotically his own 
      growth and development in distorted time relationships, while indicative 
      of Huxley's all encompassing intellectual curiosity, is suggestive of most 
      interesting and informative research possibilities. Postexperimental questioning 
      disclosed that Huxley had no conscious thoughts or plans for review of his 
      life experiences, nor did he at the time of the trance induction make any 
      such interpretation of the suggestions given him. This was verified by a 
      trance induction and making this special inquiry. His explanation was that 
      when he felt himself "deep in the trance," he then began to search for something 
      to do, and "suddenly there I found myself—most extraordinary." <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
      this experience with Huxley was most notable, it was not my first encounter 
      with such developments in the regression of highly intelligent subjects. 
      One such experimental subject asked that he be hypnotized and informed when 
      in the trance that he was to develop a profoundly interesting type of regression. 
      This was primarily to be done for his own interest while he was waiting 
      for me to complete some work. His request was met, and he was left to his 
      own devices while sitting in a comfortable chair on the other side of the 
      laboratory. About two hours later he requested that I awaken him. He gave 
      an account of suddenly finding himself on an unfamiliar hillside, and looking 
      around he saw a small boy whom he irnmediately "knew" was six years old. 
      Curious about this conviction of a strange little boy, he walked over to 
      the child, only to discover that that child was himself. He immediately 
      recognized the hillside and set about trying to discover how he could be 
      himself at 26 years of age watching himself at the age of six years. He 
      soon learned that he could not only see, hear, and feel his child self, 
      but that he knew the innermost thoughts and feelings. At the moment of realizing 
      this, he felt the child's feeling of hunger and his wish for "brown cookies." 
      This brought a flood of memories to his 26 year old self, but he noticed 
      that the boy's thoughts were still centering on cookies and that the boy 
      remained totally unaware of him. He was an invisible man, in some way regressed 
      in time so that he could see and sense completely his childhood self. My 
      subject reported that he "lived" with that boy for years, watched his successes 
      and his failures, knew all of his innermost life, wondered about the next 
      day's events with the child, and like the child he found to his amazement 
      that even though he was 26 years old, a total amnesia existed for all events 
      subsequent to the child's immediate age at the moment, that he could not 
      foresee the future any more than could the child. He went to school with 
      the child, vacationed with him, always watching the continuing physical 
      growth and development. As each new day arrived, he found that he had a 
      wealth of associations about the actual happenings of the past up to the 
      immediate moment of life for the child self. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      went through grade school, high school, and then through a long process 
      of deciding whether or not to go to college and what course of studies he 
      should follow. He suffered the same agonies of indecision that his then 
      self did. He felt his other self's elation and relief when the decision 
      was finally reached, and his own feeling of elation and relief was identical 
      with that of his other self. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 
      subject explained that the experience was literally a moment by moment reliving 
      of his life with only the same awareness he had then and that the highly 
      limited restricted awareness of himself at 26 was that of being an invisible 
      man watching his own growth and development from childhood on, with no more 
      knowledge of the child's future than the child possessed. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      had enjoyed each completed event with a vast and vivid panorama of the past 
      memories as each event reached completion. At the point of entrance to college 
      the experience terminated. He then realized that he was in a deep trance 
      and that he wanted to awaken and to take with him into conscious awareness 
      the memory of what he had been subjectively experiencing. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      same type of experience has been encountered with other experimental subjects, 
      both male and female, but each account varies in the manner in which the 
      experience is achieved. For example a girl who had identical twin sisters 
      three years younger than herself found herself to be "a pair of identical 
      twins growing up together but always knowing everything about the other." 
      In her account there was nothing about her actual twin sisters; all such 
      memories and associations were excluded. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
      subject, highly inclined mechanically, constructed a robot which he endowed 
      with life only to discover that it was his own life with which he endowed 
      it. He then watched that robot throughout many years of experiential events 
      and learnings, always himself achieving them also because he had an amnesia 
      for his past. <br>
      Repeated efforts to set this up as an orderly experiment have to date failed. 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Usually 
      the subjects object or refuse for some not too comprehensible a reason. 
      In all of my experience with this kind of development in hypnotic trances 
      this type of "reliving" of one's life has always been a spontaneous occurrence 
      with highly intelligent, well adjusted experimental subjects. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Huxley's 
      experience was the one most adequately recorded, and it is most unfortunate 
      that the greater number of details, having been left with him, were destroyed 
      before he had the opportunity to write them up in full. Huxley's remarkable 
      memory, his capacity to use Deep Reflection, and his ability to develop 
      a deep hypnotic state to achieve specific purposes and to arouse himself 
      at will with full conscious awareness of what he had accomplished (Huxley 
      required very little instruction the next day to become skilled in autohypnosis) 
      augured exceedingly well for a most informative study. Unfortunately the 
      destruction of both notebooks precluded him from any effort to reconstruct 
      them from memory, because my notebook contained so many notations of items 
      of procedure and observation for which he had no memories and which were 
      vital to any satisfactory elaboration. However, it is hoped that the report 
      given here may serve, despite its deficiencies, as an initial pilot study 
      for the development of a more adequate and comprehensive study of various 
      states of consciousness.</font></p>
