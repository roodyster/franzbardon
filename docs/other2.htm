      <h2> <a NAME="27letters"></a>22 Hebrew letters versus 27 letters listed 
        by Bardon's Quabbalah.</h2>
    </center>
    <p><b>From an email (by M.G.):</b> </p>
    <p><i>There's always been something that has puzzled me regarding the Key. 
      It's very obvious that this book is based on the original hebrew quabalah. 
      However, in the original hebrew qabalah, there are only 22 letters whereas 
      in Bardon's Key&nbsp; he lists 27. What is the origin and significance of 
      the 5 additions?</i> </p>
    <p><b>Reply by PA:</b> <br>
      <i>The answer to your question is very simple:</i> </p>
    <p>The Hebraic alphabet consists not of 22 but of 27 letters. You forgot the 
      final ones. These 27 Hebraic letters are distributed in 3 classes: </p>
    <p>I.) Simple letters with the numerical values 1-9: Aleph (1), Beth(2), Gimel(3), 
      Daleth(4), He(5), Vau(6), Zayin(7), Cheth(8), Teth(9). <br>
      They represent the mental plane with 9 orders of angelic powers (Agrippa). 
    </p>
    <p>II.) Letters with the numerical values 10-90: Yod(10), Kaph(20), Lamed(30), 
      Mem(40), Nun(50), Samekh(60), Ayin(70), Pe(80), Tzaddi(90). <br>
      They represent the "heavenly things within the 9 spheres of heaven" (Agrippa). 
    </p>
    <p>III.) Letters with numerical value 100-900: Qoph(100), Resh(200), Shin(300), 
      Tau(400), Kaph-final(500), Mem-final(600), Nun-final(700), Pe-final(800), 
      Tzaddi-final(900). <br>
      They represent the lower things: the four elements and "5 species of composed 
      things" (Agrippa). </p>
    <p>Sources: <br>
      Agrippa, "De occulta philosophia" Book III, chapter 30. <br>
      Isreal Regardie: "The Golden Down" Book I, p. 103 (for the numerical values 
      of the Hebraic letters). </p>
    <p>Agrippa continues after this explanation how these 3 classes of letters 
      are subsequently divided in 3x3 = 9 subclasses and how they are used to 
      compose sigils of divine names (he gives the example of how to compose the 
      sigil of the Angel Michael = Angel of Fire). </p>
    <p><a NAME="27letters_rawn"></a><b>Rawn Clark's comment about my reply:</b> 
    </p>
    <p>I just read your comments of July 15th regarding the discrepancy between 
      the 22 Hebrew Letters and the 27 Letters mentioned in KTQ and I have to, 
      respectfully, disagree with your assessment. </p>
    <p>Your comments focus upon the *gematria* or numerological value of the Hebrew 
      Letters and there are indeed 27 numerical values when the final-forms are 
      considered.&nbsp; However, this has little to do with KTQ.&nbsp; In KTQ, 
      Franz focuses upon the *speaking* of the Letters not their gematria.&nbsp; 
      In Hebrew, the final-forms are spoken exactly the same as their standard 
      forms and do not differ in sound.&nbsp; Their only differences are in their 
      numerical value and in how they are physically written. </p>
    <p>What Franz has done in KTQ is attempt to represent all the sounds that 
      it is possible for the human to vocalize.&nbsp; In the opening of KTQ, Franz 
      is not employing the Hebrew alphabet, instead he uses the Chek/English equivalents. 
      For example he says the first letter is "A".&nbsp; In English, "A" is a 
      pronounceable vowel.&nbsp; In Hebrew however, the first letter "Aleph" is 
      not a pronounceable vowel.&nbsp; Unlike English, the Hebrew alphabet itself 
      is made up of 22 consonants which are pronounceable only with the addition 
      of *vowel-points*.&nbsp; "Aleph" becomes the equivalent of the English "A" 
      only when the vowel-point "tsere" is added. </p>
    <p>If you put the 27 letter-sounds from KTQ up next to the 22 Hebrew Letters, 
      I think you'll find that the 5 final-forms do not account for the difference. 
      In fact, there are many differences between the two sets of symbols.&nbsp; 
      Some Hebrew letter-sounds do not even appear among the 27 KTQ letter-sounds.&nbsp; 
      For example, the TZ sound of Tzaddi and the TH sound of Tav are both missing. 
      Similarly, there are letter-sounds listed in KTQ which do not have Hebrew 
      corollaries. </p>
    <p>The result is confusing, especially since Franz then applies these 27 letter-sounds 
      to Qabalistic formulae based upon the Hebrew alphabet.&nbsp; In practice, 
      they don't equivalate directly and the only solution is to learn enough 
      about the Hebrew language so that one can effectively translate from one 
      set of symbols to the other. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>

    <p>This finding is quite astonishing to me ! We all know, that the 360 spirits 
      of the "earth zone" as thought by Bardon are the ruling powers that govern 
      or direct the lower spirits of the elements. So why should part of these 
      lower spirits be listed on the same place without any distinction as the 
      higher or governing angels? Has Bardon been in need only of a number of 
      spirit names to complete his grimoire? - I can't believe that this was the 
      case. What could have been Bardon's reason for this take? There must be 
      some hidden occult - spiritual knowledge behind this enigma. </p>
    <p>What is your opinion? Any suggestion will be added onto this place; just 
      email me or post it to the Franz Bardon Forum. </p>
