<font size=+2>Franz Bardon Bulletin (FBB)</font></h1></center>

<p><br>"I think that a bulletin board (or something like it) would be of
ENORMOUS help to those who are just starting out with the system. This
should be a place where hermetic magicians (new or experienced) can come
and post a message or a question in hopes of getting answers from other
hermetic magicians who also practice. Or perhaps even a place where we
magicians can simply write helpful hints or share experiences with other
hermetic magicians like ourselves, who practice the same system. I think
that we can all accomplish the Great Work by ourselves, but I also think
we can speed up that process and make it much more rewarding if we come
together and help each other when our fellow magicians need it. I really
think that hermetic magicians must stick together as a group and help each
other out, while still maintaining their own individual practice which
is a foundation of bardon's hermetics. I know that bardon stressed secrecy
concerning powers and faculties, warning the magician not t oboast or brag
about his abilities...but I don't think (and this is just my opinion) that
this secrecy extends to the simple act of giving helpful advice to fellow
hermetic magicians (after all, even you wrote a few helpful hints on your
webpage!). I just don't see anything wrong with this and I never have--but
it always puzzled me why people on the WEB never talked about it--maybe
they just never had a place to talk about it??" (jb)

<p><a NAME="28-7-97"></a>#1 (Sat, 28 Jun 1997): As far as the exercises
are concerned, my own experience has been as follows: Regarding the exercises
for one pointedness of mind, I have a very good friend who is a Zen Buddhist
and has a lot of experience in concentration exercises, he advises me that
even a Zen Master does not achieve complete one pointedness, what I should
aim for is to keep intruding thoughts to a background and to a very low
level of activity, which is what I do. I can hold on to an idea pretty
well with maybe a couple of other passing thoughts right in the background
on the edge of consciousness. PA: I really appreciate the view of your
friend, but I have to tell you, that there exists definitely a state of
ABSOLUTE one pointedness of mind (no background low level thoughts). I
think you are very close to it. Regarding visualisation with 1, 2 or 3
senses, Im quite good at this naturaly so its not really a problem. PA:
So you are fortunate, I had a lot of trouble with visualization as I began
to practice. Do you have also full control over either separate sense modality?
(It is important!) For example are you able to: 1. "listen" IN YOUR ORDINARY
STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS to a birds singing as if there would be realy a
bird in your room (without imagining the picture of a bird)? 2. "put" a
hallucinated tomato near a real tomato with absolute no difference between
the two? 3. "feel" a gentle breeze just sitting in your chair at home without
imagining something else? 4. "smell" flavor intensely (no pictures)? 5.
"taste" a banana as if you ate one a minute before? P.A.: You don't mention
vital power in your message. How do you go along with it? Where my efforts
really go are in the exercises with element accumulation, which, I ve had
great difficulty with, but am getting better at. What I notice here, is
that the feelings of heat and cold are felt more as a vibration rather
than a physical feeling, although sometimes this will occur. Earlier this
evening I was practising an accumulation of the water element. When I started,
I was quite hot and perspiring, but after a few minuits, I felt a coolness
all over me, and on a psychic level, a vibrational coolness in the room
I was in. What I d really like to be able to do, is to condense this element
so well, that I could make myself shiver, but I think this will take some
time. PA: Yes, it's only a matter of practice. If you advance you will
need element accumulation very often and therefore you will be very good
doing it.

<p><a NAME="22-7-97"></a>#2 (Tue, 22 Jul 1997): Replay to #1; Regarding
the questions You raised in reply to my letter, well, firstly Im afraid
I don't share your optimism that Im close to that state of absolute one
pointedness of mind, and, I can't really ever see myself attaining that
state either. As I said earlier Im moderately good at visualising with
the sense of sight, but the exercise concerning the Tomato would give me
trouble in so far as I can visualize it in great detail, but, when it comes
to exteriorizing it out of my mind's eye, onto let's say a table in front
of me I still have considerable difficulty. As far as visualizing, with
the sense of hearing, this is where Im really good, I ve been blessed with
this ability from birth, and, I ve never had to work a single day on it.
I can listen to your bird singing without any problems, I can even recreate
a song in my mind with Vocals leading instruments background instruments
and harmonies all intact. As I say I ve always been able to do this since
I was little, and have never ever needed to do any exercises in this regard.
When I was a child I showed a great talent for music and my music teacher
found I had perfect pitch and could indentify any interval played on the
Piano, so this may all be connected. Smell and Taste Im not bad at I can
do fairly well, although I ve never really given these senses much attention.
Concerning accumulation exercises, as I indicated in my previous letter,
Im getting better at this though in the past I ve had real difficulty in
this field, it's about 10 months that Im practising 3 to 4 times a week
these exercises....some weeks every day and now Im making some progress,
though as I say it's a vibrational coolness or heat, not really strong
physical heat or strong physical coldness, Id like some advise on how to
perfect these exercises. I did n't mention Air because (this may be all
connected with my ability to re-create hearing) I found I could handle
this element straight away with no practise required, and I needed only
a little practice to achieve a good condensation of the Earth element.
I did n't mention Vital power because it's always confused me. I never
really worked out what it was, what it's made up of, what plane of manifestation
it belongs to, and what element it's closest to, perhaps You could clarify
for me.

You mentioned [in FIRST STEPS (PA)] how discouraging he is in his books,
saying how difficult is will be for the novice to master his system. I
think the reason for this was your first suggestion. He wanted to discourage
the "merely curious" as well as those with evil motives. FB knew about
the powers of autosuggestion, and the power of words, (which you discuss
in your thesis). He could've written in a more postive way. But I think
he wanted to make as negative an impression as possible. I guess that's
his way of testing the seeker's sincerity! He seems to say: "If you are
really sincere, you won't let me discourage you anyway." Another thing
that confuses me is the description of "the occult anatomy of the human
body." It's in the theoretical chapter dealing with "Man". It describes
the polarities of various parts of the human body. I'm not sure what to
make of that, or how it can benefit the student. I guess I should post
in a magic forum!

<p><a NAME="11-8-97"></a>#4 Submitted by M.G.: 11 Aug 1997 First some things
about me. I work with Bardons system about 14 months. At the beginning
his exercises were really hard and i thought i wouldnt make it. Also as
u said, his writtings r sometimes really discouraging, and so i searched
for more information about him and his system, to look more behind the
scenes. At last i found your homepage :) and i think its a great thing,
because working together and exchanging experience can help everybody,
new magicians too learn and experienced magicians too help. I must agree
to #2 that the Vital Power is very confusing, because i cant find the right
place to put it in. I think its akasha at the physical level, only renamed???
But i am not really sure. The problem is if i cant determin what vital
Power is, i cant really work with it. So if some1 knows please answer me.
Thanks.

1997 Subject: "Thought Control" in First Steps. I'm talking about the very
first mental exercise in FB's course. The student is instructed therein
to watch his thoughts, for at least ten minutes, without the slightest
distraction. This sounds like a piece of cake, but for those who have never
done meditation exercises before, it's not that easy. I'll tell you about
my own experience, so you can judge how I'm doing. Hopefully, other beginners
will be able to relate to this, too. (It's hard to tell how we're doing
when we don't have anyone to compare results with!) When I first started,
the thoughts came rushing in so fast, all of them simultaneously. I also
experienced many distractions. One of the biggest ones was music. My thoughts
would swing from left to right, depending on the kind of music playing
in someone's room.... And as I sat on the chair, I could feel every physical
discomfort I had(itchy back, stiff neck, etc.), even as I tried to relax.
This was the case especially when I worried about everyday problems. Lastly,
time seemed to move VERY SLOWLY. I mean, it felt like I was following my
thoughts for so long; but when I was done, and I'd look at the clock, it
was only for some minutes! This went on for a while. (Maybe because I had
no previous experience with meditation?) But later on, I developed a better
attitude, and grew more patient. The thoughts now flow slowly. I find my
mind blank for several moments before the thoughts come. I also feel more
comfortable. Music doesn't bother that much, either. I can welcome new
thoughts without forgetting the exercise, so long as I stay calm. I worry
less about the time, also. I watch my thoughts now for 15 minutes, with
a few distractions now and then, especially near the end. It would be good
to hear from other practicioners about this. My question is: How can you
tell exactly when this exercise is mastered? Is it when the thoughts slow
down, or when we are never distracted by outside noises? For other beginners
who say they forget easily during the exercise, I can only give this much
advice: relax the body even before your scheduled mental exercise. Say
your mental exercise is scheduled for 7pm, relax and stop worrying around
6:45pm, without getting sleepy. By doing so, you'll calm down but still
be alert, at a natural pace. During the exercise itself, I breathe regularly
and slowly, too. It helps keep my mind focused. This is what I can say,
though I am not into yoga, etc. What are your own experiences? Are there
any techniques that the inexperienced doesn't know about? DD

<p><a NAME="13-8-97B"></a>#8 Submitted by Paul Allen: 13. Aug 1997 Working
with Vital Power: First steps. I wanted to discuss Vital Power in my "First
steps" treatise. But there is coming in every day new material, and I simply
have almost no time for the treatise. (Part 3 is almost completed.) Therefore
I'm writing down in rough the most important practical points concerning
Vital Power to enable everybody to begin to work with it. You can talk
for hours on the theoretical aspects of vital power, so lets go directly
to practical matters. As I began to practice I had no idea, what this VP
should be about. It was obvious to me, that VP is a life sustaining force
and that it's called also prana, chi, ... But when it comes to work practically
with it, then you need more informations. Therefore I did read the books
by FB again and again, but I couldn't find any further explanation. I was
really upset by this lack of information (for that reason I had some very
unkind thoughts in regard to FB at this time). I didn't simply know what
to do next. Furthermore I had not yet made any contacts with other people
working with Bs system (I was still in my teens). At a total loss as to
what to do I decided to experiment. I started out with the sentence "According
to his character, each individual will feel this entering of Vital Power,
through the pores, in a different manner." (Magic Physical Training (II):
p. 71.) Therefore I thought, that at first VP eventually could be considered
as a kind of FEELING. After having pondered this for a while I sat down,
relaxed completely, and began to breath as I had learned with the breathing
exercises of the Magic Physical Training of step (I). With every inhaling
and also with every exhaling I thought the word "VITALPOWER" (perhaps it
may help I supposed) and tried to feel "something" entering and leaving
through my pores. After tree or four weeks I succeeded: I felt something
strange entering through my pores: a feeling never experienced before in
my life. It was like a current, prickling and tingling in a pleasant way,
a feeling of coolness but not the usual feeling of cold (water element):
very unfamiliar. After entering my body it circulated through my entire
body and was most intensely felt in the chest region. By chance I had practiced
a principle which is very important and well known in occult literature
e.g. Ignatius of Loyola: DOING AS IF. You start with the wish to do something
and then you pretend doing it. After a while you will start to do it in
reality. ----------------------------
<br>Is this enough or do you need further explanations? (Of course VP is
not only a feeling ... but you have to find out for yourself). If you just
now at this stage of development are good at visualization you can in addition
visualize a white-golden light entering and leaving through your pores
as you breath. (Addition: you may use the word prana or chi if you like
to repeat a mantra with every breath to aid focusing attention: "VitalPower"
is a rather long term; on the other hand "Vital" and "Power" are very powerful
words.) I hope this helps a bit ... I wish you all out there a good time,
Paul.

1997 "Southpaw" means someone who is left-handed. (Usually a boxer.) Subject:
"Doing As If" in food and air impregnation--First Steps. This concept of
"doing as if" which PA mentions, is interesting because I've been doing
something similar, without knowing it. I'd like to discuss Magic Physical
Training in the First Steps. In the First Steps, we are taught to impregnate
food and air with our desired qualities, such as health, peace of mind
etc. At first, this seemed to be a very odd thing to do for me. I had my
doubts. ("How can my desired quality ever find its way into the air I breathe?")
And as I tried to impregnate the air, I thought only of a good quality
I wanted to have, which was basic strength or "fortitude." My thoughts
focused on the fact that I WISHED to have the strength. My thoughts did
not focus on actually GETTING it. So what happened was, my desire to get
this particular virtue increased, but I never actually got it. That was
until I gained a better understanding of impregnation and the will to create.
I realized that I have to BELIEVE that the desired quality is the air or
food. I have to BELIEVE that I gain inner strength as I breathe and eat
them. I have to BELIEVE that I ALREADY have the strength. The key to impregnation
or creation, in my humble opinion, is faith. We "will" a desired quality
into the air or food. This by itself is an act of creating by the magician.
Why do we need faith, and to "do as if"? Because when we impregnate air
or food with a desired quality, (such as health, etc.) we are causing something
to happen directly from akasha, the original source of all things. Therefore,
we draw fresh resources from akasha, and it's up to us to give these resources
shape. We must do so by our sheer authority, imagination and will. This
is like Jehovah who created light(creation) where there was darkness(the
uncreated), by merely commanding "Let there be light". Now in practice,
we may start this act of faith with what appears to be pretense or make-believe;
i.e. we "pretend" to have a desired characteristic. Here's how I use faith
in impreganation: I start by impressing my desired characteristic so strongly
on the food or air. If I eat a mango, I am sure that I eat Vitamin C. But
I must be just as sure that my desired quality is also there. (It helps
if I have a picture in mind, symbolizing the deisred quality. For example:
when I impregnate with fortitude, I think first of the Trump Card "Strength".)
As I bless the fruit then, I really believe that the fortitude is there
along with the vitamins. It can be so real for the most talented, that
the desired quality seems to be staring him in the face. All the time,
I draw upon my willpower and faith; I put aside all doubts by a kind of
"one-pointedness" of mind. As I eat, I stoutly believe that I am gaining
in fortitude. If the willpower is weak, I make-believe; but as I get a
clearer idea of what fortitude really feels like, when we have it inside
of us, I again use my willpower. The clearer your picture is of your desire,
and the stronger your will, all the better! After my meal, I carry the
feeling with me. Just as vitamins are consumed by the body, so do I absorb
the impregnated quality. At first, I believe I had the quality. But later,
I actually got it. And now, it is always with me. It is now a part of my
personality, and my desire has become a reality. At every moment, I feel
stronger than before I started. This is only from my own experience and
way of thinking, and I only wish to share. Perhaps, autosuggestion also
plays a part. If others feel they have a better understanding, I'd be glad
to hear of it! I can use some hints myself! This is just to give others
an idea of some form of impregnation. I'm sure that other practicioners
do it differently. One last thing: during impregnation, try not to strain
the physical body, or we'll get tired unnecessarily. If the impregnation
makes someone tired, or he gets a headache, he may be trying too hard.
(I've been there; I know!) Never mind if the beginner fails initially.
In time, with consistent practice, he'll improve. I still have a long way
to go, but I have no doubt that I have improved. Sincere wishes for success,
DD

Aug 1997 Subject: practicing the Step 1 activity "Blanking The Mind". If
you have any advice on practicing the Step 1 activity "Blanking TheMind"
I'd love to hear about it. >Yes of course, there are one or two methods
not mentioned by Franz Bardon which can aid. It depends on your ability
to visualize. About 25-30% of people are good at visualization just by
nature. Therefore please tell me, how you're doing with it. I seem to have
a natural ability to visualize, I see pictures in my head all the time,
... >You are one of these lucky men, who have the natural ability to visualize.
Therefore I will translate into English for you the method explained by
Brandler-Pracht in his German book "Lehrbuch zur Entwicklung der okkulten
Kraefte (Text-book for the development of occult powers)" published by
Dieter Rueggeberg Verlag, Wuppertal, which is mentioned also in the First
Steps treatise. This part on blanking one's mind is his best, other items
in his book are very questionable in their value. It is obvious that he
had a lot of experience in mind blanking exercises, and therefore his method
is of considerable value. It seems, that he was a very visual oriented
person, because most of his methods are based on this modality. (By the
way, do you know Richard Bandlers book on submodalities? It is very good
and gives lots of examples on the manipulation of visual patterns.) Brandler-Pracht
calls the blanking of mind "the negative state" (of mind). (As you know,
my English is not so good, but I hope you will get the main points.) ---
Here begins my excerpt of Brandler-Pracht's book --- ... = stands for omitted
parts. (Part one, Chapter 3: The negative state.) ... Only such a person
who is able to concentrate will eventually master a state of mind which
is best called "(STATE OF) NOT EXISTING" ... ... All thoughts have to be
banned from one's mind. In the very moment of a single thought's birth
it must be destroyed at once, this is absolute necessary to master the
ability. We have to blank the mind inasmuch that it resembles an empty
sheet of white paper; we have to forget in this state everything, even
our own existence. ... If you practice the negative state than you have
to stay perfectly immobile. ... Furthermore it is very important NOT to
get sleepy, yet without fighting sleep to hard otherwise you will be distracted
from your concentration. ---(annotation by Paul: I understand this as:
if you fight not to get sleepy you are concentrated on this fighting process
instead of remaining "blank". Now comes the main method.)--- ... Now close
your eyes and imagine in your mind a white disk of 20 cm diameter (= about
8 inch) which is continually spinning around his axis, on a black background.
You have to suppress all thoughts which may arise about the disk or other
matters, focusing your concentration only on the even and quiet spinning
of the white disk. The first attempts in this practice will always be a
struggle but your ability will increase by every repetition of the task.
After 10-12 repetitions you may be able to hold this picture for about
3 minutes; then try to expand the time until you are able to hold it for
10 minutes. If you reach this point, then you can go on to the next step
with this exercise: replace the disk with a small brightly shining point:
a little spinning point in an empty dark room without confines. Again repeat
the exercise until you are able to hold the spinning point for 10 minutes
without disturbing thoughts (pictures). If you are able to do this, then
proceed further: for two minutes concentrate on the spinning point, then
wipe out even this spinning point so that only a dark room remains. But
even this black room has to vanish, first replaced by an undefined gray
then fading out to nothing. This is the desired state and you should be
able to maintain it for at least 10 minutes. If you are able to hold it
for 10 minutes with your eyes closed, then repeat the exercise with your
eyes open. Fix your eyes on a 1m x 1,5m even canvas or piece of paper,
in order not to get distracted by your surroundings. Later on discard the
paper or canvas and fix only an empty point of space. At last you should
be able to do this exercise in every place and surrounding. --- Here ends
my excerpt of Brandler-Pracht's book. --- ... but those do not always appear
as though in front of my eyes. They seem to be located behind my eyes inside
my head. I can make them very clear and vivid this way, though again this
faculty does not seem related to my eyesight and it takes a slight effort
to make something appear as though in front of my eyes. >This is heard
often from people which are able to visualize strongly. It seems that locating
the pictures inside the head is a strategy to distinguish imagined pictures
from real pictures. Again I suggest to read Bandler and Grinder for detailed
explanations on "reality structures". ... though again this faculty does
not seem related to my eyesight and it takes a slight effort to make something
appear as though in front of my eyes. >We learn to do this in step 2 of
Bardons course. For me it was even easier to visualize things with open
eyes in front of myself, because closing my eyes was psychologically strongly
related to not to see any pictures (I was a very acoustic oriented person).
After mastering visualization with open eyes I learned gradually to do
it also with my eyes closed. One of my biggest problems with the blank
mind activity seems to be the interruptions brought on by my inner dialog.
>The only solution to this problem is to repeat the exercise until success
comes. This may take a considerable amount of time. Therefore it is very
important not to get bored with it in which case you will sooner or later
loose your motivation and "forget" the entire thing. The first step is
a "make or break" for the new magician (jb). There is an admonition by
Dieter Rueggeberg in the foreword to Brandler-Prachts book which is amusing
in this respect. Mr. Rueggeberg says, that one should not do concentration
exercises for more than 15-30 minutes a day because the powers may even
grow to fast so that one can't handle them properly ! I have had some success
by focusing on my breathing as a way to eliminate intruding thoughts, but
lately I seem to be getting bored with the activity which may be causing
me further problems with intruding thoughts because my concentration wanders
from my breathing. >I too experimented with a wide variety of different
methods, but without avail (I couldn't try Brandler-Prachts method because
his book was out of print and I didn't even know that it exists. Besides
this I wasn't able to visualize at that time). It seems, that the exercise
in itself is a bit boring and therefore our brain tries to find out more
interesting activities. But at last it gets used to the task and you can
remain for a long time in this state. Another "difficulty" for me was the
really fascinating thoughts which I always got when I did this exercise.
I got very deep and fascinating insights in all different kinds of matters
and that was never the case with my ordinary way of thinking. It was a
bit difficult to force myself not to continue a particular interesting
train of thoughts. >Brandler-Pracht gives a lot of practical applications
of the negative state which I may publish on the bulletin board. The usual
intrusions are this inner dialog which attempts to narrate my experience
and sometimes considers how I will write about this experience in my journal.
The other intrusions seem to be based around images which come to me -
usually of people who are engaged in some activity or something. Rarer
still are thoughts about things I need to do - these are very rare because
usually I am good at focusing on my present activity of interest and excluding
the anxieties of daily life for that period of time in which I am engaged
in an activity. >The last intrusions in my case were e.g.: "wow, I'm succeeding",
"it's great", "I had no thought for about 2 minutes I guess", etc. I have
wondered if perhaps my difficulty is related to the fact that when I considered
myself successful with one pointedness of mind, I used my inner dialog
as part of my concentration. There were no ideas in my mind unrelated to
the object of my focus, but there were a lot of ideas which directly related
to it and I had a running commentary of these ideas going on in my head.
This is how I understood Bardon's instructions on this exercise. Perhaps
I was wrong and should have practiced holding only an image and nothing
else in my mind? I tried this at first but seemed to have the same type
of difficulties I am now experiencing with blank mind. >I think your way
of practicing onepointedness of mind was OK. Brandler-Pracht explains onepointedness
of mind exactly in the way as you practiced it. I personally guess that
it's not so important if someone does it in this way or by holding only
to a picture without inner dialog, which is more difficult to do. I think,
that this exercise is mainly a preparatory one for the blanking of mind
exercise.

Re #10: Eyebaths and the astral senses. I read Victor's little note on
eyebaths with interest because Im close now to having to deal with this
problem, actualy I ve mentioned eye baths to You before. Firstly I think
You have to decide how developed your astral senses should be for the tasks
in question. If You re going to try to become perfectly clairvoyant so
You see pictures of past present and future You might be waiting for years.
What should suffice at this stage, are sufficiently developed astral senses
for evocational magic, so that a spirit called into a magic mirror can
be seen and heard; detailed pictures of everyday life in ancient Rome can
await a later date. A magic mirror could therefore be an important development
aid together with the eye baths.First You could practice seeing clearly
the four Tatwic symbols corresponding to the four elements in the mirror,
then when this has been obtained You could try the Tatwic symbol for Akasha,
and perhaps start seeing some sort of vision. The mirror would be very
useful insofar as what is seen in the mirror actualy exists independantly
in the mirror and would thus be a good test. Regards Mark

3 Sep 1997 Subject: Cultivating Attention. With regard to all concentration
exercises, I have noticed that in my own case, purposeful cultivation of
attention is necessary. This can be done daily and in almost any situation.
Some examples are: 1. For visual, tell yourself that for a month you will
notice at least six new things every day. Really look at objects, take
notes if it is convenient for you, size colour the thing itself and how
it relates to what is around it. At the end of the day, or better during
your evening dairy entry, write down what you discovered. The only catch
is, is that the objects/things are along your daily activites. Don't seek
out a new place in the beginning, notice all those things that you have
never paid attention to before. Later apply your powers of observation
to your mind and that which it contains. 2. For auditory, basically the
same practice with the respective differences. It is best to make a note
of two as soon as possible. I believe that the note taking causes the attention
factor to really come into play. 3. Olfactory, tactail, taste, all the
same with respective changes. Later once you have a knack for this sort
of thing, you will come up with variations to suit your current skill building
with repsect to the faculty you are awakening in yourself. Something I
started to do myself was during my TV time. Say I am watching a program
which I am familiar with the senery. I will not pay attenion to the actors
but the background. then closing my eyes I will build up the image in my
minds eye. checking the original etc. i will continue this until the image
is prefect and I can recall the action and almost all of the dialoque from
the program. This will help a great deal for those having trouble with
images and attention. Remember, when you are dealing with a meditation
you are dealing with two and only two things... the preceiver and that
which is preceived. Thank you for your ATTENTION. All the Best, Danny

that someone (I think it was Tim Scott) asked "What if someone can't" Indicating
that he can't continue on, because he can't master the previous stuff.
Could you pass on these words for me? "Because you are human, the very
methods that Franz Bardon teaches are accessible and any human can do them.
Therefore, have patience, and it will come. Sometimes you already have
it, and dont' know it! That is why it is helpful to have a master teach
the subject. But seeing as this is difficult in today's day and age, you
must not give up. You CAN do it, and by having the attitude "can't" you
are restricting yourself" Asher Green

18 Sep 1997 Firstly I must say I am surprised and happy to know that there
are quite a few students working with Franz Bardon's magical techniques,
therefore I feel privileged to read and to share information and hints
on the steps of 'Initiation into Hermetics' with other magical aspirants.
To begin with, most writers and scholars of the occult arts hardly ever
give Franz Bardon any credit for his magical writings, and they seem to
be blind to the fact that the spirit of Franz Bardon is a very highly advanced
adept of The Universal Laws and Powers, thus his books are indeed 'The
Gate to True Initiation'. That is why I always work and practice within
the context of Bardon's work, even though I have read and still read other
bools on Magik. I have been practicing the steps of 'Initiation into Hermetics'
for a few years and I must stress the importance of a 'Magical Diary' which
prompted me to rewrite the pratical steps and exercises and put them into
a Magical schedule of each individual exercise and step of 'Initiation
into Hermetics' to monitor my progress and development on the path, because
as some of you know time and daily mundane life on this Earth Plane makes
it difficult for the average student of the 'Great Work' to train unhindered.
I will willingly submit theses schedules of each step to the Bardon website,
which may help others on the path. (I have also put my own helpful tips
at the end of each exercise, which I gained from my own practical experience.)

<p><a NAME="19-9-97"></a>#16 Date: Fri, 19 Sep 1997 From: Victor, Scotland
caffrey@enterprise.net here is step 1 as promised the other steps will
follow shortly but as you can see they are quite large. Victor, Scotland&nbsp;&nbsp;
Introduction In this schedule 'Attaining Magical Adeptship ', the material
and techniques are drawn from the works of the great mage from Czech, Franz
Bardon. His magical material consists of ' Initiation into Hermetics '
which is a series of ten steps of arduous magical training exercises for
the mind, body and astral body which must be developed simultaneously to
provide the correct equilibrium for magical development. I have felt the
need to write this schedule for the true magical seeker and to simplify
and enforce Bardon's practices even more. Also, to update his work and
illustrate it with my own personal experiences and of other students of
' Initiation into Hermetics '. His methods are progressive and great deal
of patience and tenacity are required from the student on behalf of achieving
any kind of magical and spiritual abilities. Moreover, ' Initiation into
Hermetics ' is an outline of exercises and techniques not a ' magical system
', and can be compatible with any magical tradition or religion. I myself
have been studying and practising these steps for three years and know
from my own experience that any magical abilities is not achieved overnight.
Alas, the seeker is not transformed instantly into an Archwizard with great
magical powers, but steady and habitual practice will take him or her very
close to this stage. Of the background of Franz Bardon, very little is
known or given about him, but to know something of this enigmatic master
the seeker will be advised to read his works :  Initiation into Hermetics
 The practice of Magical Evocation  The Key to true Quabbalah  Frabato
the Magican Step One A : Mental Training attached to each exercise is a
Magical Diary 1 : Controlling your thoughts 2 : Holding a thought 3 : Vacancy
of mind B : Psychic Training 1 : Introspection, (looking within) attatched
is The Soul Mirror, ( the positive and negative effects of the elements
in the astral body) C : Physical Training 1 : Habits 2 : Physical exercises
3 : Conscious breathing 4 : Conscious Eating 5 : Magic of Water Mental
Training - Step One - Exercise one 1 : Controlling thoughts Take a seat
or lie down face up on the floor, and mentally relax the whole body. Close
your eyes and watch your train of thoughts for at least five minutes. Be
like a silent observer as though you are a little point of consciousness
or ball of light being entertained by your everyday thoughts on a big cinema
screen in the middle of a dull and darkened forehead. Try not to fall asleep!
In my own experience I have found that rhythmical breathing helps a great
deal (e.g. inhale for the count of six, hold for six etc.). Also the best
time for this exercise is early in the morning when you wake up, because
your mind is not cluttered with everyday affairs and, also in the evening
before falling asleep. With some practice these thoughts will be slower
in coming to the mind and later you could try extending this exercise by
one minute until you can watch and control them for at least ten minutes
after a weeks training. Mental Training - Step One - Exercise Two 2 : Holding
a thought After having done a weeks training on the first exercise (longer
if required), the student without rushing goes on holding a single thought
for a longer time and, he/she suppresses any other thought whilst holding
on to the thought or idea he/she has chosen to hold. The student must manage
to hold onto a single thought for at least ten minutes. Example : say you
have a thought that goes through you mind of having a cigarette, you will
hold this as an idea or image of say a packet of cigarettes floating in
front of you and, as you hold this image steady in your mind you may see
yourself taking one of the cigarettes out of the packet and lighting it,
keeping all other thoughts at bay. Other examples could be washing up,
driving a car etc. In the beginning I found it very hard to concentrate
on a single thought because the mind cannot stay still unless it is trained
through habit. It likes to jump around and experiment with many different
ideas so, you play it at its own game and experiment with the chosen thought
like the cigarettes you keep the image or idea moving rotating expanding,
but still see the same packet. Mental Training - Step One - Exercise Three
3 : Vacancy of Mind Once the seeker has mastered exercise two, he/she will
learn how to make his mind absolutely empty. Lie down or sit in an armchair
and relax the whole body. Close your eyes, dismiss any thought enthusiastically
that comes into your mind, there must be an absolute vacancy. Hold this
state of vacancy for as long as you can. In the beginning you will only
manage to do this for a few seconds but, after more practice you will get
better at it. Success in this exercise is achieved if the seeker can remain
in this state for ten minutes without losing self control or falling asleep.
In my experience I found this exercise extremely difficult. I suggest sitting
in darkened room to begin with to achieve a timeless empty situation then,
later to imagine your mind in a completely darkened black state as though
you are looking into a black hole from a pair of eyes at the back of the
skull. Psychic Training - Step One - Exercise One 1 : Introspection The
first task of this step is to know yourself and to balance the elements
of fire, air, water and earth in your astral body. The personal character
traits are influenced by these four elements, so we must achieve a magical
balance by spending some moments looking inwards and meditating on our
good points and bad points and checking which of the four elements are
dominant or lacking in these traits. Bardon requires the student to be
very thorough in his/her self-criticism and introspection, also he suggests
writing down these faults and attitudes into a magical diary so the student
can keep check which of the elements is out of balance in his/her personality.
Finally after a week of self-knowing and looking deep within ourselves,
we make a list of our positive and negative characteristics then, meditate
under which heading of the elements these would go into and we keep this
information to ourselves. Physical Training - Step One The body A magical
balance has to be established also in the body. Right after getting up
in the morning, you will brush your body with a soft brush ( I recommend
the brushes used for combing babies hair obtained from the local chemist
or baby shop) until the skin turns a faint red colour. By doing this the
pores on the body will be more open and be able to breath more easily.
Then wash the body with cold or lukewarm water (dependant on season) and
rub dry with a rough towel until quite warm. This technique will remove
tiredness, and it should become a daily routine. After that spend about
five minutes doing some stretching exercises so that the body becomes more
pliable. Breathing Sit down and relax and inhale through the nose. Imagine
that the inhaled air is impregnated with the idea of say health, peace,
success etc. And is being sucked in through the lungs and body pores into
the bloodstream. The image of your idea must be so intense that the air
you are inhaling is so strongly impregnated with your idea that your desire
has already become a reality. Start with seven inhalations in the morning
and evening and gradually increase by one more breath each day until your
desire has been accomplished. Do not rush this exercise, because it may
need more time to reach your desire than expected, it also depends on what
you are wishing for. Do not extend these breathing exercises for more than
half an hour. Later on a standard ten minute practice will do. Physical
Training - Step One Conscious Eating The same applies to conscious eating
as applies to conscious breathing. Sit with your plate of food and with
your imagination concentrate on your desire being embodied in it as though
it had already been done, consume the food very slowly and as you chew
it and swallow it imagine the properties embedded in it are absorbed into
your bloodstream in the whole body. It is best not to read, watch T.V.
or have any conversation while eating.
<p>As I practised this technique, I had to take into account my environment
and situation I was in, because some times it is not possible to do this
so it is best to accommodate this routine as much as possible. Magic of
Water The water element is magnetic. In practice we will every time we
wash our hands in a sink let the cold water draw out our weaknesses and
imbalances by visualising it flowing from the body with the water down
the plug hole into the void of infinity. Water can also be charged or loaded
astral-magnetically by charging the ether (akastra) with your desire into
a basin full of water, then it is thrown away after you have finished with
it. So others do not come into contact with it. Also sometimes when I take
a bath, I place my hands over the surface with fingers outspread and charge
the magnetic powers of the water with my wish. Remembering to clean the
bath afterwards with clean water so no charged water remains in the tub.
The eyes can also be strengthened too, by boiling some water beforehand,
adding some ' eyebright ', letting it cool down in the basin and putting
the face in the water rolling the eyes in every direction. (Clairvoyance
can also be promoted this way) Next are the magical diary, Soul Mirror

Sep 97 Subject: Quaballah Hi I was curious to know if anyone out there
has been working with Bardon's Third work "The Key to the True Quaballah".
In particular those experiences dealing with the preparation of drilling
the various letters in the micro and macrocosm. Any one interested in starting
a dialog in this subject let me know!!!! Emery emery_guillory@hp.com

<p><a NAME="29-9-97"></a>Date: Mon, 29 Sep Subject: Frabato From: Barbara_Griffith@ceo.cudenver.edu
Over the weekend I actually found a bookseller that makes it a practice
to stock ALL of Bardon's works. I treated myself to Frabato the Magician.
It gave me a lot of insight, allowing for the fact that the finished work
was actually done by a devoted student of his from notes, and intrigued
me even more. I noticed some things that puzzled me: 1. In the book he
is given the mission to write for the general public on certain pillars
of wisdom, up to the first part of the fifth. As you pointed out, only
the first two pillars were covered in depth, the fourth only exists as
little more than an outline. And of the fifth there is no trace so far
as I am aware. Does this mean that the dark forces that dogged his life
were at least partially successful in thwarting him, and if so, what do
Bardon's students make of this? Could the unfinished nature of his stated
mission be part of the mystique that inspired the frauds and imitators?
2. The book mentions a son of his, but I see no mention of marriage. I
will go through it again cover to cover to make sure I didn't miss anything
- there is a lot to absorb. Do we know anything about Bardon's attitudes
towards women? It would seem that he respected them from the fact that
at least one of them was a closely associated student of his, and there
is nothing disrespectful in his book. Yet, the presence of women in Frabato
is minor and peripheral. This could be due to the culture of his time:
I am old enough to remember when strong women showing leadership and intellectual
gifts were considered a bit outre, no matter how valuable their contributions.
It was culturally routine during my childhood to cast women only in "helper"
roles as I recall, even when the facts in real life were different. 3.
Did Bardon know Gurdjieff? Some (but only a few) of the ideas seem rather
similar: such as the concepts of the ordinary man being a slave of destiny
and only the developed man having any control over his fate, also the idea
that self-development attracts the help of higher forces, and the need
for well-rounded (not one-sided) self development. 4. I am getting the
impression that Bardon was a much nicer guy than Crowley, to put it mildly.
I am told by Crowley people that if he came to town it was a good idea
to lock up your daughters (and your sons, for that matter). I see no evidence
of intemperance or wildness in Frabato. Is there any paper trail to document
his life after Weimar Germany? 5. Are there any ideas circulating around
serious Bardon students as to what became of him after death? Frabato states
that Bardon was born in 1909 and died in 1958, making him indeed young
at the time of death, though he had probably aged beyond his years judging
from the hardships he endured (my guess, anyway).

<p>Date: Tue, 07 Oct 1997 Subject: Golden Centurium Greetings to all Friends
of FB's teachings,&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember talking a year ago to an initiate
of the OTO about Franz Bardon. I had read an article before, linking FB
with the OTO. The initiate denied this, and said that instead, that FB
had been associate with the Masonic Order of the Golden Centurium. We read
in Tim Scott's essay that Bardon was possibly a member of the Fraternity
of Saturn. Can someone help me shed light on this, and tell more about
this "Golden Centurium"? I do not have the OTO member's address right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&lt;south-paw@usa.net> Subject: Re: Frabato&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings Barbara,
Thanks for the interesting points you've brought up. I am still looking
for the Frabato book, but I think I ought to mention a few things I've
read in FB's other books, which you did not mention. >1. In the book he
is given the mission to write for the general public on certain pillars
of wisdom, up to the first part of the fifth. Bardon mentioned in his textbooks
(I'm still looking for the exact pages) that he would've very much liked
to publish "two more leaves" of the Tarot, if only Providence would allow
him to do so. This does confirm that FB intended to publish two more initiation
systems. But he mentioned also, that "this of course, depends on how much
longer I will live on this planet."(I don't recall the exact words, but
they are to that effect.) At first, this seems to be a curious thing to
say, considering that he was still young when he wrote his books. What
it does suggest is that, knowing that he was fated to die early, he sensed
that he wouldn't be able to fulfill his task. So, I think that the circumstances
of his death, whatever they were, were factors to this partial failure.
> 2. The book mentions a son of his, but I see no mention of marriage.
Bardon dedicated his second book to his wife Marie; his third book to his
son Lumir. In his inscription to his wife: "This book is dedicated to my
faithful mate, my dear wife Marie, in constant memory." In his textbooks,
he considers time and again the possibility that the magician may be female;
for instance, in the magic of water in Initiation_To_Hermetics. Whatever
his attitude may have been, he acknowledged the presence of women in the
magical path, and seems to have seen no difference. There is a book about
Franz Bardon in French, I think. See Paul Allen's FBsite for links to Bardon
books. I myself don't have the book, since I can't read French. But it
has photos of FB with his wife. > 4. I am getting the impression that Bardon
was a much nicer guy than Crowley, to put it mildly. I agree. He does seem
more prudent and reserved, and I've never heard of scandalous behavior
of Bardon's. He doesn't mention Crowley at any point. But anyway, he does
remind the magus that "love is the law, but love under a strong will."
(Initiation_Into_Hermetics) As for FB's death, we only read from Tim Scott's
essay that he appears to have died in a Czech prison. Thanks and Best regards,
Daren

Hi! Would someone care to translate this text for us? It is in German,
by Dr. Lumir Bardon Claude Dr. Lumir Bardon / Dr. M. K. Erinnerungen an
Franz Bardon Kurze Einf&uuml;hrung Der Sohn von Franz Bardon und ein pers&ouml;nlicher
Sch&uuml;ler erz&auml;hlen &uuml;ber ihre Erlebnisse mit dem Meister. Buchauszug
- (Textprobe Seite 44 ff.) Hat man einen Wunsch, so soll man &uuml;berlegen,
wozu seine Verwirklichung gut ist, wer davon profitieren wird, und insbesondere,
ob jemand dadurch keinen Schaden erleiden kann. Denn der Wunschsch&ouml;pfer
mu&szlig; die Verantwortung tragen und alles wieder in Ordnung bringen,
wenn er einen Fehler machen sollte. Jeder Mensch kennt sicher Beispiel
aus seinem Leben. Wie ich bereits erw&auml;hnt habe, hatte der Meister
einmal die Beherrschung verloren und einen Fluch ausgesprochen, dessen
negative Wirkung er wieder ausgleichen mu&szlig;te. Dabei hat mich der
Meister darauf aufmerksam gemacht, da&szlig; man immer streng unterscheiden
mu&szlig;, ob man als gew&ouml;hnlicher Mensch handelt oder als Hermetiker,
weil die W&uuml;nsche entsprechend verwirklicht werden, aber auch die Verantwortung
getragen werden mu&szlig;. Im Roman Frabato hat ihn Urgaya ermahnt, weil
er ab und zu mal der G&ouml;ttlichen Vorsehung etwas "nachgeholfen hat"
durch Verhinderung oder sogar Bestrafung des B&ouml;sen, obwohl die Zeit
dazu noch nicht reif war. Der Hermetiker sollte seine W&uuml;nsche unter
das Motto stellen: "Ich will selbst besser und vollkommener werden, um
den anderen Menschen mehr helfen zu k&ouml;nnen". Dies sollte ein Leitmotiv
sein. Selbsts&uuml;chtige W&uuml;nsche werden immer negative Folgen haben
- was keine Drohung sein soll, sondern nur eine Warnung. Ein anderes Beispiel:
Hilfe leisten f&uuml;r einen Menschen in Not, egal ob diese Not geistig-seelisch
oder vielleicht psychisch ist. Die Entscheidung liegt jedenfalls bei uns
und kann sich nach folgenden Regeln richten: 1. W&uuml;rde uns dieses Ereignis
nicht betreffen, w&auml;re uns dieser Mensch nicht begegnet. 2. Als Hermetiker
m&uuml;ssen wir erkennen k&ouml;nnen, ob es sich um eine Schicksalsbelehrung
handelt. Ist dies der Fall, und wir beseitigen die Notlage, so m&uuml;ssen
wir gleichzeitig den Wunsch damit verbinden, da&szlig; die G&ouml;ttliche
Vorsehung eine andere Schicksalsbelehrung daf&uuml;r geben m&ouml;ge. Der
Meister erz&auml;hlte mir, da&szlig; er einmal ein junges M&auml;dchen
heilte, deren Lungen von Tuberkulose bereits stark zerst&ouml;rt waren.
Da die Krankheit jedoch mit Schicksal oder Karma verbunden war, wurde er
selbst durch unheimliche Hindernisse zur Verantwortung gezogen, so da&szlig;
er gezwungen war, den Heilungsproze&szlig; wieder r&uuml;ckg&auml;ngig
zu machen. Als ich dies h&ouml;rte, hat mich Ehrfurcht ergriffen. Es klang
unwahrscheinlich, aber es ist m&ouml;glich, denn ein wahrer Adept kann
allm&auml;chtig werden, wenn er alle Universalgesetze beachtet und seine
Taten ausreichend begr&uuml;ndet. Wenn man einen gewissen Grad der Entwicklung
erreicht, mu&szlig; man die Entscheidung treffen - also den Hauptwunsch
des weiteren Lebens &auml;u&szlig;ern, und an seiner Erf&uuml;llung dann
weiterhin durch Sekunden, Minuten, Stunden, Tage, Monate und Jahre arbeiten.
Je mehr Kenntnisse und F&auml;higkeiten einer hat, desto kompliziertere
Aufgaben mu&szlig; er meistern, wenn er sich einmal daf&uuml;r entschieden

Matthias Barth's translation of the "Erinnerungen" Excerpt. Original site:
http://homepages.muenchen.org/bm671497/lumir.html EXCERPT Dr. Lumir Bardon
/ Dr. M. K. "Erinnerungen an Franz Bardon" (c) R&uuml;ggeberg-Verlag Wuppertal
(GERMANY), 1992 2nd edition 1996 (I paid DM 20,00 for it) ISBN 3-921338-18-2
loosely translated excerpt - (p. 49 ff.) Memories of Franz Bardon Short
Introduction The son of Franz Bardon together with a personal student of
the master tell about their experiences with him. The following phrases
are based on the "remarks to hermetics" by Dr. M.K.: l) Wishes Whenever
you have a wish, you should sincerely regard, what purpose you like to
perceive by its realization, who would profit from it, and especially,
whether there is anybody/anything who might be harmed by its realization.
We emphasize this, because the hermetic wish maker has the responsibility
for ALL consequences which occur by realization of his wish - and he has
to take care about the faults which arise from his wish/longing. Every
human beeing knows examples for these faults from his own history. As mentioned
above (not in this excerpt), the master once lost his self-control and
uttered a course against somebody; afterwards he was deeply involved in
magickal activities to get rid of the negative consequences of his rash
deed. So, the master mentioned to me, that you have to make a clear distinction
between acting as a "normal" person and acting as a hermetic - whatever
you say/wish/think in your ordinary life and social surrounding, it definitely
induces another kind of responsibility for occurences linked with your
statements, wishes and thoughts, then the wilful embedding of those statements,
wishes and thoughts in a hermetic/magickal context. In "Frabato the Magician",
Urgaya blames frabato, because from time to time he was disturbing the
divine providence, by rushly preventing the evil or punishing evil people,
although under the circumstances prevailing at that time, his "good-will"
actions were (obviously?) set too early and insufficiently (mentally) prepared.
The superior intention of a hermetic and his magickal expressed wishes
should be: "I wanna be better and much more perfect, to be able to help
other people". This should be the central theme. Selfish wishes always
have negative consequences - and that is not a threat, it is a sincere
warning. Let's consider a specific example: helping suffering people by
hermetic means. Without regarding the specific form of suffering, we have
to find a principal decision, and this decision should be made by considering
the following thoughts: 1. How much would we feel involved in the nature
of that suffering, if we would not know the specific human being, which
is suffering. 2. A hermetic has to recognize, whether the suffering is
based on destiny, intended to teach the suffering person, or not. When
the suffering is based on such a fateful instruction, and when we remove
the suffering cause and/or symptom, then we have to pay a prize: we have
to formulate a wish, that the divine providence may find another way of
fateful instruction for this specific human beeing. The master once told
me, that he had healed a young girl, whose lungs were severly damaged by
tuberculosis. Afterwards the master was instructed by eerie circumstances,
that the tuberculosis of this girl was deeply linked to her karma/destiny.
So, the master was forced to undo the hermetic healing. When I heard about
that, I felt reverence for the hermetic universe; it may sound unlikely,
but it is thinkable and therefore possible, that a true adept of hermetics
might get allmighty, when he achieves the ability to consider all universal
laws, to read the divine providence, and therefore gets the key to formulate
his wishes in a universally consistent magickal language. Within your (lifetime)
study in hermetics and development of your personality there is a breakpoint
(linked to a kind of initiation or not) where you have to formulate your
personal central theme, your principal wish for your life, and you have
to work on its realization in every second of your conscious/hermetic life.
The more knowledge and abilities you achieve, the more complex and difficult
tasks you have to master - when you honestly decided to keep on the track,
ie. to realize your personal central theme. On your hermetic way, following
your personal central theme, you will collect occult knowledge and develop
abilities to communicate with strength, intuition and power for your specific
purposes, in a way which is beyond the experience of ordinary people. So,
you won't talk about the tasks related to your personal central theme to
other people; the intimacy of your hermetic approach to your principal
wish is a necessity to secure the abilities you already achieved; when
you entertain your social surrounding with stories about your hermetic
life, you really disrespect it, you loose control and the divine providence
may punish you, by weakening or even disabling your hermetic view and abilities.
And especially the inability to help other people by hermetic means is
the most awful punishment for a hermetic, a loss for the sine-qua-non for
any hermetic's principal wish of life. Within hermetic "adolescence" your
longing to communicate about your personal hermetic experience will fade.
There is a need for a kind of intimacy between master and student, to discuss
about hermetic techniques and to help the student on his/her way to hermetic
initiation, to give him/her all the guidance and encouragement (s)he needs;
that was the way Franz Bardon instructed me - so I cannot describe all
examples for the public, the reader would not be able to make sense of
it.

some interresting facts and guidlines, which, if u overthink them, can
be very helpfull. There r some photos in the book of FB and his familie
and a description from his son and student, how they saw him. Its nice
background. Im not exactly sure that there is no English version of this
Book (plz tell me). If theres no English version i will try too translate
the whole book 4 u (its only about 100 pages). Pherhaps somebody will help
me???? ?) If there r any logical mistakes i made in the translation, excuse
me, but plz tell me, i will correct them. The footnotes reflects my own
opinion on some topics, only something too discuss over.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
the translation of the Textprobe form Memorys of Franz Bardon i havent
finished it now, but i will do it in a few days. (Alas theres another life
out there)&nbsp;&nbsp; I translate it in first person, but its orginalz
written in the someone Form (e.g. if we have &lt;=> if someone has)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The son of Franz bardon and his personal student write their experience
with Franz Bardon. If we have a wish, we should think the purpose of the
wish and who will benefit, but more important, who will lose if the wish
gets real. Then if we create a wish, we are liable on the result of the
wish and we've too clean up the mess we made. As i mentioned before, the
master lost his control and made a curse on someone, but he had too compensate
the negative influence of the wish. The Master remebered me, that its diffrent,
if we action as "normal" humans or as Hermetiks, because if we perform
a wish as Hermetik it gets real and we must face the consequenzes. In the
book "Frabato" Urgaya admonished Frabato because Frabato "punished the
evil" (1) So a Hermetik should make his wishes in the following context:
" I will get better and more perfect, for being a greater help too others"
This should be our key not in live.Selfish wishes always have negative
results - this isnt threat, only a warning (2). For example: To help an
Human, physikal od psychical if he needs it. Our decission could be made
of the following rules: 1. If we aren't affected in this happening , we
would nerver met this human (3) 2. As Hermetiks we must recognize, if it
is Karma or not. If it is Karma and we remove his suffer, we must give
him an equal fate." The rest i will transl8 in a few days (if u wish).
Now the explanation of the footnotes i made. This is only my opinion and
not involved in the original Text: (1) i think the phrase "punished" sounds
not very well, because its subjective. Its only the opposit of good and
relies always on the circumstances so evil cant be punished because we
dont know what evil is. The experienc of good and bad is our way, the way
we learn and gain further, to go further good and bad and stand above them,
then good isnt good or bad, then because it exists a good god, it must
exists an evil good, so god is more then good or bad, or? (2) You will
allways harvest what u r seeding, so if u wanna be loveed by others, u
must love others, or if u wanna be beaten by others, u must beat others.
Its only the matter of what u WILL.&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) I dont know if this
is sexpalind very well, so i will give an example: if im meet someone and
i could do something 4 him, then i should do it, because if i cant do anything
4 him, i wouldnt be confronted with this problem (??? i hope this is better,
if not, i tried it :) ?????)&nbsp;&nbsp; C U, better Read u, next time,

I don't agree !! It's most important to discuss personal experiences with
other people, WHO HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. Only this way we can establish
a common opinion on the matter. Yet Claudio is right in one point: if someone
has no experiences, then all words come to nothing. But even in this case
one can learn from others, who indeed have something to say. Theoretical
discussions on practical matters without personal experience are also quite
meaningless (perhaps this was meant by Claudio). There are some persons
around who state, that one cannot talk on occult matters because they are
so subjective in nature, that the true essence can never be expressed in
words. But this is true also of all other experiences! You can never tell
someone what the true nature of tasting sugar is. But you can talk with
any other person about it, who had the same experience. Best wishes, Paul.

<p>PRACTICE?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HI! I just started over my Frabatical
practice (after I had a frabational guru and fell from jnana yoga practice).
The first experiment consists in a technique known as WITNESS (sakshi).
It consists in creating a separate ego, called THE WITNESS, who will monitor
without intruding the 'remanant egos'. To vaguely quote Kaivalya upanishad:
I am the witness separate of all ... I was not born ... The mantra is :
Om sakshi namah (vaguely: glory to the witness) The next exercises require
sunnya sunyata (<b>emptiness</b>). It can be achieved with neti neti technique,
but You better follow Frabato! Yours Truly, Claudio&lt;:) (p.s. I see wittness
is used as word, but I used WITness, instead!)

Hi Joel, It seems you doubt that Bardon wrote the fragment of the Fourth
Tarot Card because it lacks the dry humor of the original. I've got only
the first three books so far. But I read somewhere that the English translator
of "Frabato" is a different one from the translator of the other books.

Dear readers and friends- I am happy to begin my first correspondence with
what I hope will be a circle of genuine brothers and sisters on the difficult
and winding path to enlightenment. What has drawn me to the studies of
Franz Bardon is the way his words speak directly to the very core of my
soul- there's always such an optimistic tone in his words, a profound understanding
of human nature and the difficulties and temptations which we constantly
face. I am struggling, as I'm sure many of you have, to practice my exercises
every day, several times a day, if possible. There are times when I fail-days
pass by and I do not practice my exercises (although I still consider myself
a student). When I neglect hermetics, I feel empty inside, because (and
this is greater than Bardon himself-my life, especially my dealings with
other persons, improves vastly when I steadfastly follow the Initiation
into Hermetics course. I am young, 28, and I've dabbled in the occult (UFO
groups, Catholic "fringe" groups, Gurdjieff-Ouspensky centers) since the
age of 14, and I feel so very alone in this world, where, unfortunately,
"work on oneself" seems to imply expanding one's stock portfolio, not the
capacity for love and wisdom. I am requesting a chain of correspondence
with any and all practitioners of Bardon hermetics-please e-mail me at
tolou@ix.netcom.com. I am so happy to find persons who follow Bardon, I
felt like I was the only one in the world! P.S. I'm married, and my wife
doesn't practice Bardon. It's really difficult to focus on doing the exercises.
Any advice (she doesn't judge my ideology, it's just difficult to live
up to the role of husband sometimes)? My most humble wishes of love and
blessings to you, my friends, Alberto

flamato &lt;:) My Farenheits are thus settled. Thanks. Hre some points
on Frabato: -the system is very ordered -the zones are organized, the Earth
zone has 360 'Heads' which might be called Angels -at birthtime (of ev'ry
situation) a head is on the horizon for about 4 minutes. It is pure joy
to analyse a map (birthmap) using the 'basic' 360 Heads. I have Mercury
on 25 Saggitarius and thus the Silent Angel is there (we had 25 grade Sagittarius
borrowed from fb bulletin lately) -some asceticism is needed to perform,
though Frabato is very liberal. We are not speaking Hare Krsna here, but
it is obvious India (Bharata) influenced His teachings on that peculiar
aspect. -I did not venture as far as evocational magic(k) -It is possible
to contact a Head mentally -No ritual will work if astral and mental planes
are not included in it. -Kaos magick is possible after some big revelation
about the nonsense of names and forms, kill Buddha, kill every tought of
what enlightment be. There is Enlightment Intensive as technique of jnana
yoga. Jnana deals with causal e.g. "Who am I?". -those dissatifsfied with
lower mysteries, and 'mere witchcraft' will naturally tend to Higher Truths.
Some skip all this. Savikalpa Sammadhi (meditation) skips the angel/devel
zone. Ultimately all forms and rites are illusive. That is, 'IN TERMINE'.
-IN VIA even this list is an experience. The less we feel attacked (EGO,
Motta), the less and least we have enemies or need for circles (Abramelin).
-I am vaguely acquainted with Dee's systemata and found it profoundly mathematical
and precise. Order over XAOC? -The subroutines soch as aggeloc thon theon,
the mailing lists of the omniverse, are helpful to the student. -my (ex?)
guru is much happy with Crowley, Frabato and Wicca, too. He sort of loves
'em all and understands and will discuss. -since there is not much janan
yoga-magick link around (Tesla) I tried to speak yoga as a magickal device,
note Crowley did that , too. -Frabato mentiones LOVE UNDER A STRONG WILL.
-Koenig 'the spammer Kong' held some info about Satvrnvs lodge -Fluids
(Barbara, Kat) are used not only in Bardon's system. -Lumir quotes we must
think doing good. I did not and cured cancer where I should let be? A Head
may cure cancer. I used a 5 element technique I described in short before,
and a mantra, namely: om hriim hamsah Thus a mantra IS a magickal device.
The mantras are not Aryan only. Krsna was dravid (black man from South).
-Virtual Jerusalem hosts helpful Rabbis if some of us need a quabbalistic
advice. -Frabato's Quabballah is peculiar: he mentions no Jews, no trees.

G. Subject: Energywork&nbsp;&nbsp; I ve just finished reading Peter Dexheimer's
"Energywork". I found the book very interesting,but,there is one thing
Im very curious about. The system of using the formulas in the book,only
concentrates on the sound aspect; the 3 sense concentration, colour,sound,elemental
analogy is ignored. I would have thought that the 3 sense concentration
is fundamental to the realisation of causes associated with the respective
formulae. Yet I remember You saying that You found his technique very powerful....even
an untrained person can get some results. What was your own experience
and how important do You think is the 3 sense concentration? Regards Mark

thirty years of experiences with all different people all over the world
it is proven over and over agein that you don't have to use the 3 sense

according magical abilities. I know that there are some people who are
not able to believe, that this energywork is as easy as it is. But this
is just a personal consideration and will hinder all of those who believe
in it. Believing will prove itself right. If you get some basic formulas
to people e.g. "E-F", you will see the success even they don't know what
the formula meant. Just be open and test it. Peter

the only thing is that if I were to do one charging per session, I do n't
think I'd be able to keep count of 3X462....1386 repetitions,even using
the method of finger counting You showed......and,at the same time concentrate
properly on the letters.So I would probably just use time as a measurment.
Would half an hour as an equivalent of one charging suffice?>> The important
thing in the work with magical formula is: Don't complicate it!!!!! I know,
it is hard to believe to have so much success with simple toning some letters,
but it is. I prove and proved it by myself for the last 12 years. So, when
you formula you will get the practice to do it with the fingersystem also.
Just train it it, till it comes by heard, ok. E.g. "D-C" needs almost 12
minutes for charging time, for beginners, if they use the fingermethod.
When the formula automaticity is created, it needs 9 till 10 minutes. But
you can formula just for 15 minutes without the fingermethod. Then you
will charge up all formulas anyway. The formulas with 3 or 4 letters would
take more time to get charged up. But the more important thing is to formula
regularly day by day at least the first six day and then at least every
third day. Then you will have the fastest effect. Formula work is not a
job for some weeks. It is a livejob and even more important after your
live, because then you will need it maybe more. When you use the formulas
for some months you automatically will get the feeling how long to exercise
a formula and when. There are different methods to check out the formula
time, but for beginners it is more important to formula a little bit more
then to try to get it faster, because of the negative power consciousness
which will hinder you by thougts. So take care that you differentiate what
are your thoughts and what aren't. I put this explanation on the FB-Forum
also, so everybody can use this explanation for himself. best wishes Peter

Re: Repetitions From: PDexheimer &lt;PDexheimer@aol.com> Hello Mark, &lt;&lt;Hello
Peter, thank You for taking the time to reply to my e-mail. I will put
into practise your advice. However it did strike me that to charge a formula
in 15 minuits would require You to do one formula in less than one second
since You are doing 1386 repetions in 900 seconds. I do n't think I could
do it that fast....at least in the begining,so I was thinking of doing
30-45 minuits per session. You in your book advise against this. Would
I be risking serious problems if I went on for this length of time?>> Well,
you will experience the energie you charge up. Just be carefull at the
beginning with the formula energy. After some weeks or month, your body
will increase his frequency and you will be able to hold a lot more energy
than at the beginning. Especially the formula "D-C" you schouldn't charge
up longer than 15 minutes, but you have to decide by yourself. If you formula
according the fingersystem, then you will charge up each formula 3 x 462.
Then it isn't important how long you need, as long as you don't think to
charge up a formula during ten hours. Use the time to formula and take
15 minutes or use the number of 3 x 462 and forgot the time. Again, don't
try to make it more complicated as it is. It is and will be a very simple
method. best wishes Peter

Subject: Re: Repetitions&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in receipt of two emails regarding
P.Dexheimers Energiework. I have'nt read the book, just whats at the FB
website. The emails confirmed my intuition that the system was but a energy
reservoir or battery system. This method is covered in XXXXX of Initiation.
Also stated are the drawbacks. In a private email to Paul Allen I commented
about the problems to be associated with the system or any indeed any other
practice. In a more temperate version I will put forward my criticisms.
It is not a faster, more efficient version of the Tetragrammatonic Quabbalah.
It is totally different. If you read KTQ it is apparent the powers and
experiences that can be achieved. You could be a servant of the Divine.
It may not be the ultimate but its the best I know. By following a battery
system you are condemning yourself to imagining a result and chanting away
until you get what satisfies you. Where is the growth, the spiritual education,perhaps
the spiritual tasks if all you are pursuing is your own selfish goals of
lottery numbers and casual sex ? Battery systems are available in different
flavours from different sources and any good student should be able to
find them. Not just in chanting, mantra, japa, but also in affirmations,
lovebombs, visualisation and physical actions If I were to propose that
anyone could pick up Initiation into Hermetics and within days achieve
the results mentioned I would be laughed at. And deservedly so. Then why
is the concept of someone doing something similar with a more complex work
accepted ? In my email to Paul Allan I compared the honest hiker who struggled
to reach Everest base camp to the trash tourist who arrived at base camp
by helicopter and would shortly be transported up the mountain by sherpas.
One person would know he had honestly achieved. Another in a mist of self
delusion would claim he had climbed Everest. For me there is no comparison.
If you feel that you must experiment with Mr Dexheimers Energiework: Do
so. But do not delude yourself that you are doing anything else than battery
work. Tell lies to the entire world but never to yourself. If you were
chosen to succeed in Mr Bardons system you should be capable of studying
what he has written and making a decision as to other methods. In that
spirit of honesty and brotherhood I give you my opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul

Hello! An interesting subject! I have no experience in charging the talisman
(or whatever) in such I way. I am aware Franz Bardon describes the procedures
in detail, but would dare ask an example i.e. a sketch of an experiment
done, if possible. After discovering William Mistele's evocation made public,
I too much believe in sharing at least 'drafts', sketches and hints. Bear
in mind I am most untrained, but rather aware and in the process of training.
I guess the process requires impregnating the (talisman) object with holy
sounds. What puzzles me most and most of You take it as daily routine,
is splitting into 3 kinds of 'bodies' and working on 3 levels (actually
4 is the number, if causal can be called a 'body'). I am aware this is
coaxing for You, and might thelepat doubts, but we are not all the same

By following a battery system you are condemning yourself to imagining

? Who decides what is a spiritual task, what is a spiritual education,
what is a spiritual selfish goal? Who says which way we have to go to reach
spiritual freedom. To say that we condemning ourself if we imaging a result
means that we should not be the creaters of our world and should not decide
what is best for us. That we should listen to a God who tells us what is
right and what is wrong. This was the speech of the Dominicans and all
who didn't listen to them get killed to "save" their souls from hell. But
still we all create our world day by day, second by second, if we believe
it or not. We have done it for aeons and will do it in the future, because
we are Gods!!! And every God has the full right to create what he wants
to have. I would be happy, if everybody would have the same interest than
I, because than I would have a lot of supporting players in a great game
full of fun. And we play a game. Call it seriously or not, it is still
a game. Spiritual growth means to become free from identifications we builded
up and became what we are today. If we let all identifications be, we will
be again what we are at the beginning of this game - the creators of it.
But what is after that. Well, we will have another game and I mean this
very seriously. &lt;&lt;Battery systems are available in different flavours

six years and in this time I found real dogmatic structures from the different
astrological forces. So was the Capricorn the meaning that we all hade
to work realy hard to have the right for success. He said that we have
to climb a mountain by feet so we can have the great feeling at the top.
The Sagittarius was flying to the top and was enjoying the world around
him. Ang the Pisces was sitting in a cave and melting with the whole world,
wondering why somebody had to climb a mountain to get that feeling. Understanding
that there are no two similar beings helps us a lot to get more tolerant
to the meanings of others. And there is no RIGHT way. There are as many
ways as beings are. Because each being is a creator and builded up his
world till this present time. And each being has to go back his own way.
So I would propose that we try to go our way and maybe help others to find
theirs but not to tell them through our own ignorance what will be right
for them. &lt;&lt;If you feel that you must experiment with Mr Dexheimers

In that spirit of honesty and brotherhood I give you my opinion.>> A friend
of mine, who is able to use the method from Franz Bardon told me the main
difference between the two systems. He said the "Battery System" by Cuno-
Helmut M&uuml;ller give you at once the energetic field you want to have
to become what you like. And beside the main effect from each formula,
all formulas awakens the spiritual cinsciousness. To be in this "batterfield"
you can grow up, till you don't need the formula energy any more. With
the Franz Bardon System you start to grow up without this energyfield.
Lets say as an example that you would need with both methods one year that
you have a certain ability (inculded spiritual consciousness). The main
different would be that one can have the effects much quicker with the
M&uuml;ller system and has not to wait for. Everybody who had a real hard
toothache will know what is meant by the M&uuml;ller system to have the
effect of the formula "E-W" at once and not just in a year of hard drilling
exercises. This longer way sounds a little bit for masochists, but at the
end there will no God standing and welcome you that you went the hard way.
I'm not interesting how I become spiritual free, but I'm very interesting
to get it as fast as possible. But everybody has to find their own way
to reach his goal. Peter

stomach and intestinal cramp,in addition to nausea and dizziness I thought
I would pass out. This was at about 11.00pm last night. Up until midday
today my bowels were still unsettled and all throughout last night I had
not completely recovered. All this discomfort from only 3/4 of one consolidation!
So I ll have to gradualy get used to doing increased amounts. >> Seems
that you have some strong cleaning effects. What you have to do is going
through it with the formulas. Don't become afraid of the phenomenons. These
just show you how many strange energies are trying to control you. Do your
formula exercises especially with "D-C", "D-S" and "J-H-W" and you will
come out of this sensations as the winner. If you stop, the control of
the strange energy will become stronger, so get rid of it. If the sensations
become to strong for you, use "E-F" and "C-K" and the allove formula "S-A-L".

<br>CHARCOAL, impure form of graphitic carbon (q.v.), obtained as a residue
when carbonaceous material is partially burned, or heated with limited
access of air. Coke, carbon black (qq.v.), and soot may be regarded as
forms of charcoal; other forms often are designated by the name of the
materials, such as wood, blood, bone, and so on, from which they are derived.
Charcoal has been replaced by coke for reducing metal ores in blast furnaces
and by natural gas as a source of carbon in making certain chemicals, but
it is still employed in making black gunpowder and in casehardening metals.
Formerly, charcoal production from wood was an important source of acetone,
methyl alcohol and acetic acid, all of which are now produced from other
raw materials. The use of special manufacturing techniques results in highly
porous charcoals that have surface areas of 300-2.000 square metres per
gram. These so called active, or activated charcoals are widely used to
adsorb odorous or coloured substances from gases or liquids, as in the
purification of drinking water, sugar and many other products, in the recovery
of solvents and other volatile materials, and in gas masks for the removal
of toxic compounds from the air. They also are used as catalysts in making
certain chemicals (e.g. phosgene sulfuryl chloride) or as supports for
other catalytic agents

the exercises from Franz Bardon? &lt;&lt;If you care to read KTQ you will
see reference to a letter system by J. B. Kerning @page 53. Mr Bardon points
out the dangers therein of such onesided work.>> STOP!! M&uuml;ller warnt
in the sixites to use formulas in the feet because of shizophrenia. It's
not COMPARABLE what Kerning, Weinfurter etc. is teaching and what M&uuml;ller
is telling. If we try to talk about this we should be able to differentiate
very exactly, otherwise we mix up different fields and methods and become
confused. &lt;&lt;I think a major part of the email was concerned with
who am I to state what is or what is not spiritual. I can only supply my
opinion and my ability to read the various books by Mr Bardon. If I have
misunderstood the reply in content or on a point please correct me but
the above is a clear statement based upon my own knowledge and my reading>>
It can never be a question who you are to state what is spiritual. It's
just important, that we know your definition about it. Than we are able
to communicate at a level where understanding is possible. For me, you
personnal experience is really important, not so what has been read. I
by myself have read a lot, but also I've to tell you that the most wasn't
worth to look at it. In all of my books I declare to not believe me. Stay
open by mind and proof the written principles in your daily live. If you
can found them, they will be true fpr you. If not the will be not true
for you. Not the written word is importand but the daily experience!!!!!
But this is just my opinion. Peter Dexheimer

May I suggest you read page 53 of Key to the True Quabbalah and make decisions
accordingly.>> What Bardons describes is NOT the function and result to
work with the formulas. Just give a person the Formula "E-F" if she has
trouble with her friend and let her use the formula according the Muller-System.
But DON'T tell her what the formula is. If the dispute vanishes, than you
should realize that there is no God or Goddes according page 53 from the
True Quabbalah. Or give a person the formula "D-S" and tell her she should
use it, when her husband is trunken and want to hit her. Again DON'T tell
her what the formula does. But if the trunken husband don't hit her (what
he did for years) then reread page 53 of the True Kabbalah. Peter Dexheimer

ones genetics, so as to change appearances? I don't know why but it seems
that any where my butt goes, everyones seems to be concerned with their

who is concerned with his looks enough that he would use his Magic or any
suitable ritual to materialize his objectives of improving his personal
appearance. Bardon mentioned in his Practice of Magical Evocation book
a head of the zone girdling the earth named "Cepacha", which is supposed
to be endowed with wisdom concerning beauty or vanity. Has anyone had contacts
with this head and what actually can he do, or what sort of information
does this head provide?

M Subject: Genetic alterations Dear Gem, There are several spirits of the
earth zone which are concerned with external appearance and beauty. Just
look harder. Mr Bardon in IIH gives details of the impregnation of water
for beauty and youth. There are several formulae that could be used in
KTQ. The question has to be asked for what purpose do you wish to improve
your looks ? Business, attractiveness to partners, or because of a nagging
itch inside yourself ? If unhappy about yourself do some analysis. It is
a natural human action to keep smart, make the most of your appearance
but to moan and whinge about your looks is not good. A Bardon student would
do something about their appearance depending on the aim or desire involved.
And no, you can't change your genetics, same as you can't change your parents.
You can alter your genetic potential by drugs, radiation, noxious substances,
cigarettes. But we all know that. As a student you can change anything,
if allowed. Best wishes for the new year Paul

M Subject: Re: Repetitions Dear Peter and all other readers, The purpose
of this correspondence was to show there is an alternative voice to to
the statement inherent in your books that anyone can practice what is in
Mr Bardon's KTQ. All they have to do is ignore the warnings and chant.
I contend this is not so. Tetragrammatonic Quabbalah is as distant from
this practice as cargo cults to Buddhism. If people wish to practice what
you teach, fine. But at least they have the opportunity to read an opposite
opinion here. Anyone who has studied Mr Bardons system will know that visualisation
and related exercise are not a great drain on inner resources. Shamanistic
chanting exercises are. For those who have'nt experimented consider theiri
own feelings after a sports match they were an active shouting spectator
at. I would love to help mankind, but as I have not been granted a mission
or the great knowledge associated with the task I had better try to perfect
myself and what litte good is available to me. With reference to toothache
as an analogy of spiritual hunger. I don't think they compare. I would
offer someone my library to read but I would not recommend Mr Bardon unless
asked a straight question. I believe in fate and spiritual growth. You
have to be lost before you can be found. Re Kerning: Unfortunately I have
not read Kerning or Cuno-Hellmut Muller so I cannot compare. But I may
suggest they are alike insofar as they do not offer a balanced system as
recommended by Mr Bardon. Re experience I have been a Bardon student 24
years. During that time I have made many sacrifices and received many blessings.
Made ambitious plans and experienced terrific failures. But I have always
been a student. I keep an open mind but I object to someone appropiating
Mr Bardons work and then claiming that you can do Q by just chanting. Mr
Bardon was not a fool. He stated the warnings because there are real dangers.
Similarly you cannot do Q unless you have the four sense concentration.
You cannot have four sense concentration unless you have a working knowledge
of the elements. This you obtain by virtue of an initiation. Energywork
is not Quabbalah. I contend it is a battery system and that someone uninitiated
might just a s well chant cabbage cabbage as EF relating to harmony or
domini domini as to DS relating to control. This is my opinion but I suggest
you read your source book KTQ to find references or are you going to state
Mr Bardon was a fool, mistaken or fooling us his students ? Best wishes

in Wuppertal, Germany. As you probably all knowhe his is the publisher
and of most foreign translations of Bardons work. He just turned 60 years
of age. Besides being a strong defender and promotor of Bardons work he
has also a uncanny inside of world affairs. He is very pessimistic about
the near future in Europe. But thats an other story. What is important
is that he is running out of money to reprint all the different versions
of the Bardon Books. If he doesent find any co-publisher for the French
translation of Bardons books he will not be able to finance them. And then
there will be no more Bardon books in French. He is hoping the world-wide
Bardon community fill found an non-profit charitable foundation that will
preserve Bardons work in all the different languages. He mentioned that
the work of Rudolf Steiner is being preserved in this fashion. Mr Ruggeberg
also believes that there are strong forces (black lodges for example) that
wish very much that Bardons books will disappear from the face of the earth.
This can not be allowed to happen. I'm sure among Bardon' friends wordlwide

Subject: Greetings in light Greetings in light to all... I hope that this
one will reach the board... I am relatively new tto this area even though
I am reading about occult for many years now. I was looking for a teacher
since nothing seem(ed) to work for me. When I bought my first books from
Bardon acouple of weeks ago (urged to do so by Allen's page) I was impressed
!! For the first time in my life I found something solid to begin with.
Of course i am encountering some problems and I would eb greatly obliged
if someone could help me. 1. First of all my vizualisation skills are extremmely
poor. I belong to the class of people that the think in words not images.
So i ma finding extremelly difficult to vizualise the simplest image (I
am currently trying with the tattwa cards) either with my eyes closed or
open. When I think that it is actually possible to see something plastcally
in front of you it's seems like a dream to me. So can anyone please provide
any usefull tricks or hints or exercises...? 2. Second I cannnot understand
what Bardon means by sayng concentrate on a single thought. I can concentrate
rather easily on a relevant train of thoughts (like thinking of love for
example and discussing with yourself about the social aspect, the emotional,
the physical etc.) I can even solve mathematical problems in my mind without
being distracted by I cannot understand the meaning of a SINGLE THOUGHT.
3. I am close to Brussles so I am very interested about the meeting in
March. Can someone provide me with more info please... NOTE: The Allen's
site seems it has some problems today. My browser responds by an error
: connection reset by peer. For anyone who can do something about it.....

<p><a NAME="26-2-98"></a>Date: Thursday, 26. February 1998 From: Paul Allen
&lt;allenpa@hotmail.com> Subject: Re vizualisation and onepointedness of
mind Hi Ian, Your question is quite important I think because a number
of people asked me the same or a similar thing. In regard to your question
on one-pointedness of mind we have to consider first that diverse people
have different concepts about what they call a "thought". As I pointed
out in my "first steps" treatise there are visual oriented and auditory
oriented people. For visual types a "thought" is a picture or a succession
of pictures (film). For auditory types a "thought" consists of a word or
mostly a succession of words (one or more sentences = intern dialog). You
say that there exists no thing like "one thought". This may be true for
you, because even when you concentrate on one idea, there is always a sentence
composed of A NUMBER of words. But a visual oriented person can hold one
exclusive picture and he will call this picture "one thought". Even in
your case you may call for example "love" or the word combination "love
eternal" a single thought. Now in regards to Bardon's onepointedness of
mind the aim of this exercise is to EXCLUDE all thoughts which have nothing
to do with the chosen one. Here it's not so important, if you choose a
single word, a sentence, a train of thoughts, a picture or a succession
of pictures (film). The important point is to exclude all words and/or
pictures that have nothing to do with your concentration object. The reason
of this exercise is to learn to concentrate WITHOUT DISTRACTION on ANY
given item (even on nothingness - void in the next exercise <b>"emptiness
of mind</b>"). When you have mastered this exercise your success with the
following exercises in step 2, 3 and so on will come easily and you will
proceed quickly. If you haven't mastered this preparatory exercise, you
will constantly be hindered by distracting thoughts. So you see, Bardon's
system is VERY sophisticated and every exercise depends on the previous
ones. When you have learned onepointedness of mind you proceed to emptiness
of mind. Here you learn to suppress all diverse kinds of mental processes:
pictures - sounds (words) and feelings (emotions). This is a very important
faculty because in step 2 you have to concentrate say on sounds without
the corresponding pictures or on pictures without the corresponding sounds
and with no internal dialogue. This is very difficult to do when you haven't
learned previously to suppress a given sensory channel. If you are not
used to concentrate on a given sense modality then you will slip constantly
into your preferred sensory channel. If you know how to suppress ALL sense
modalities then these concentration exercises will be a lot easier.&nbsp;
Regarding your question on visualization: I was also a very auditory oriented
person. First I had the problem that I couldn't even believe, that people
can see real pictures in their mind's eye. Then I read the book on Nicolai
Tesla who assembled whole machines in his imagination and who tried in
vane to invent something to photograph his imagined pictures from his retina.
This book convinced me that indeed some people can visualize so strongly
that there is no difference between a real and a imagined picture. So I
began to do visualization exercises as prescribed by Bardon, but without
success. The problem for me was, that when I first focused say on a pencil
and then closed my eyes I couldn't see anything at all: I saw only the
black or brown-reddish color of my closed eye-lids. "On what should I focus
my concentration when there is nothing ... " I thought. This was very frustrating
for me. I overcame this problem by pretending. Even when I didn't see anything
I said to myself: "I see a pencil". Then I discovered that visualization
was easier for me with my eyes open. After a wile I could hold pictures
for short times (say some seconds) also with my eyes closed. And so I learned
gradually to visualize. When I look back, than I must say that the biggest
difficulties were my feelings of frustration and my thoughts of doubt.
The only thing which matters is to do a given exercise regularly. If you
worry about success, then you will always have a hard time doing your exercises.
If you don't care about success, you can practice with easy and comfortably.
There exist some aiding exercises to help people who are poor at visualization
when they begin to do their first visualization exercises. Please check
the upDates-list of this site, I will put them there in a few days. Best
wishes, Paul Allen.

the universe is made up of the four elementals and akasha and the electric
and magnetic fluids, cosmic letters, etc. If you the cause you set in motion
is strong enough, it produces results and this can be done immediately
if your cause is stong enough and well-designed. The physical plane is
constructed of very dense material and the atoms and subatomic particles
for example are loaded with the strong and weak nuclear energies, bound
by gravity, as well as electro-magnetic forces as in chemical bonding in
the shells of atoms. If you want to make a change in the phsyical world,
you either do something very small at just the right time like a snowball
at the top of a snow covered slope to cause an avalanche or else if you
may wish to go up against all sorts of forces which are directly opposed
to your will. In the later case, you have to apply equal magical force
to proceed. If someone wanted a lot of money for example, they might be
able to get it with a volt depending on their karma. The way some individuals
I know get wealth is that they study computers for five hours a day for
five years in high school, go to college, major in computer engineering,
go to Harvard business school and get an MA in business, all the time writing
programs for various companies during the summer . Then the vice president
of Ford Motors begs them to come work for Ford or Bill Gates hires them
and gives them all sorts of stock options. One in five employees at Microsoft
including janitors and so forth are millionaires from those stock options.
On a good day Bill Gates makes a billion dollars. Now that is magick in
action. If you want to produce the same wealth by pure magick, well, you
have to somehow create the same degree of mental capacity, emotional enthusiasm
and dedication, and physical activity. Not real easy to do. Like I say,
it depends on what you may have done in other lives. On the other hand,
I am being very coy about what can be done through magick. You can change
the world forever like Jacob who wrestled with an angel and got a blessing
which would last for the history of the world on his offspring. As for
going back in time and changing the past, well, I feel sometimes that I
have incarnated into the past from the future. In other words, if you can
see the future, then the present moment is like being alive in the past--you
get to alter what shall be because you can tell what is will come and how
it can be changed. Time gets rather meaningless at times for a magician.
You look back thousands of years and it seems like yesterday or like this
morning or like right now. > > With regards to the beings FB indicated

I don't know much about materialization or dematerialization. Not my specialty.
I mentioned to my wife one day I was going to meditate on a hurricane and
a few hours later it stopped dead in the water and then a few hours later
made a 90 degree turn and headed north but I don't think that proves anything.
And it is a little hard to impress my wife. As for the beings, there are
as real to me as anyone else, in fact, I would have to say they are a little
more real than anyone else. I prefer spending time with them than going
to seminars with various famous teachers. I learn a whole lot more. On
the physical plane, I want a taste for their energy and a feeling of their
presence and I am not going to ask them to have tea with me or paint my
house. I am not on that level of development. But I do expect them to help
out when I am trying to accomplish something. And this they will do according
to my abilities and the amount of energy I can condense and the will I
can muster at the time. As I am trying to suggest, if you have an MA from
Harvard in business and then make a request to a spirit specializes in
business success, you are a whole lot more likely to get miraculous results
than if you don't like to work and can't plan or follow through with anything
unless of course in a previous life you were Carniege or Henry Ford. Then
you may wake up in the morning and acquire a huge amount of capital by
evening selling an idea. > > With regards to the practice of clairvoyance,

I was clairsentient after working a little bit with the polstice and praying
about it using visualizations. I could feel energy of anything just about
anywhere though it takes a while to develop accuracy and the ability to
interpret what I am feeling. I would suggest being careful with trying
to make an immediate breakthrough through force of will and magick when
it comes to opening your chakras and psychic abilities. In a sense, it
is not so difficult to acquire psychic abilities as it is to some how reign
them in once you are opoen to all sorts of non-human realms in which human
existence means little or nothing at all. >What >do images in the magic

a magick mirror. I don't use any physical impliments. It has something
to do with my karma. I will occasionally visualize a magick mirror. The
basic exercises require being able to visualize people, places, and so
forth with complete attention to detail as if the image is real. If you
can get this, then your brain has the training to take an impression or
connection to a spirit and reproduce an image which appears as if you are
seeing it with your physical eyes. It takes a lot of training though I
know a few indiviuduals who could do this sort of thing from childhood
without training of any kind. All these psychic abilities can be acquired
but again it depends on previous work in other lives and how much dedication
is involved in your current life as well as your blood line and natural
talents. Yours, Bill

these thought trains with yourself, could you have air prominent in your
internal make-up ? Take the single thought but don't allow the train to
develop and run. Go back to the thought and after banging your head against
the wall you will understand there is more understanding than following
thought trains of already known knowledge. Consider if you were involved
in a magical operation. Would you really want the distractions of a wandering
mind and the monkey chatter of listening to yourself ? If you are familiar
with the phrase mind-mapping and so on it becomes understandable. If research
is required think Zen buddhism and Koans. I too would like to go to Brussels,
unfortunately I would only go as a beer fest. The prospect of meeting my
peers and listening to lectures brings me out in a terrific thirst. Best
wishes and remember, all the above is only my opinion. Paul

M Subject: Re: doubting thomas (jmagus)&nbsp; Dear Vamp, To answer all
your questions at once please go to Bill Misteles homepage where his personal
experiences will solve some of your problems. If I may suggest you should
review your elemental balance as from your letter it appears you are suffering
from vaulting ambition. Nothing wrong with that in normal life but in hermetic
studies you cannot allow yourself to be controlled by the elements. If
the work involved is too much and the time taken is too long I would suggest
one of those chaos/madness/drug/sex cults so that you can have your experiences
and illusions quickly. Once your physical and mental health is wrecked
you can always come back to hermetic studies to recover. But all that time
spent is wasted. Good luck and don't take this posting too seriously, Paul

I am working currently on the destruction of thoughts but I have never
understood it fully as concentration on a sensory channel and even destruction
of all sensory perceptions. I know of course what you mean by it and I'll
start working with it from TODAY!!! > Regarding your question on visualization:

all these systems a long timenow and I have problems I don't know where

> >Daren > >Here comes some elaboration. If you observe something really
closely, as in look at, concentrate upon. There develops one pointedness.
Nothing else exists save the object which dominates your consciousness.
You may do it already when listening to music. You probably did it as a
child watching TV. Its no big deal. Moving it round to aid your development
is a good deal. It means you can fix your concentration upon an object
or task or situation with ferocious intensity. Thus developing the magical
concentration and will. If further elaboration is required please ask a
specific question. I do email in the mornings and my "one pointedness"
is crap at that time ! Good luck Paul
