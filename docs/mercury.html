<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Mercury Spirits = Shem Hamphorash</H1>
<HR>
<P>Not all people know that the Mercury Spirits as detailed in Bardon's PME are
derived from the Bible. Therefore they are a piece of Western Mysticism, a part of
the Quabbalah which is according to Yudelove: &quot;an esoteric, or hidden,
explanation of the meaning of the Torah. The Torah is the first five books of
the Bible. It is said to have been written by Moses and consists of the books
Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. It is handwritten on
scrolls in synagogues all over the world and printed in Hebrew, English, French,
Chinese, and so on, in every Bible published anywhere on earth. It would appear
obvious that mystical traditions would arise among the jews, just as they did in
all other religions. The Kabbalah was a secret tradition for most of its
history. It was an oral tradition handed down from master to disciple.&quot;</P>
<P>Kabbalists believe that from many parts of the Holy Bible can be extracted
Holy Names or names of Angels.<BR> The Angelic Names of the Mercury Spirits are
contained within 3 verses of the 2nd book Mosis, namely Exodus: chapter 14,
verse 19, 20 and 21.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="dreibild.jpg" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/dreibild.jpg"><BR></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The three verses translate to English as follows<BR> (thank
you DD!):</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and
went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them,
</B></LI>
<LI><B>and stood behind them: and it came between the camp of Egypt and the
camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by
night: and the one came not near the other all the night.
</B></LI>
<LI><B>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the
sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land,
and the waters were divided.
</B></LI></OL>
<P> Everyone of those 3 verses is composed exactely from 72 letters (The
Hebraic alphabet reads from right to left!). These 3 verses are written one
beneath the other but the 2nd one has to be written inversely. Then the 3
letters of each row form one Angelic Name to which has to be appended the key of
power suffix -al or -iah, -al meaning &quot;Power&quot; and -iah meaning &quot;Mercy&quot;.</P>
