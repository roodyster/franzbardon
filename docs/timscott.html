    <hr>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Franz Bardon is 
    one of the most important but least known occultists and magicians of the 
    Twentieth Century. He is mainly known through four books he wrote which were 
    published in the 1950's. Many have borrowed his techniques and terminology 
    without giving him proper credit, sometimes unknowingly, but not always. I 
    recommended his book "Initiation Into Hermetics" to a person who had studied 
    occultism for some years. He was stunned to find that a teacher of his in 
    the past had distributed Bardon's materials pretending he had written them 
    himself. </font> 
    </p><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon was 
      unusual in that he stressed practice and practicality above all else. Although 
      his books contained lengthy theoretical sections, his emphasis was on the 
      tangible, usable results of magickal training. His stated purpose was to 
      give the serious student of magick the most complete and best possible magickal 
      instruction obtainable outside of an occult lodge and without the benefit 
      of a personal teacher. Did he succeed? The only way to judge is by trying 
      his curriculum yourself. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bardon's Life and 
      Work</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon did 
      not appear to be trying to create a legend about himself. The only self-references 
      in his works are occasional attestations that he had himself tried this 
      of that experiment or ritual. I can't resist comparing this to a much more 
      famous magician of this century who wrote voluminously about his own life 
      and adventures, and had no qualms about glorifying himself in so doing </font> 
    </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to 
      his student and close friend Otti Votavova, Franz Bardon was the oldest 
      of 13 children, and the only son of a very devout Christian mystic, Viktor 
      Bardon. Although he had achieved a certain amount of spiritual advancement, 
      Viktor felt that he was unable to obtain and advanced initiation, and prayed 
      that he receive this blessing. The story is that an advanced soul entered 
      the body of his son Franz to become Viktor's initiator. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In later life, 
      Bardon became a stage magician who gained some fame in Germany in the 1920's 
      and 1930's under the stage name "Frabato". </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Adolf Hitler 
      and his Nazi party ascended to power in the 1930's various groups such as 
      the O.T.O. and the Freemasons were banned and some of their members arrested. 
      Otti Votavova avers that Hitler belonged to the legendary "FOCG" or "99 
      Lodge" of black magick, described in Frabato The Magician and Fire And Ice 
      (see the bibliography). Apart from this, Hitler and some of his intimate 
      friends were supposed to be members of the "Thule Order," which was the 
      external instrument of a group of powerful Tibetan black magicians. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Arrest &amp; Imprisonment 
      by the 3rd Reich</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through the 
      negligence of one of Bardon's disciples (who had not destroyed their correspondence 
      as Bardon had ordered) the Nazis arrested and imprisoned them both in late 
      1941 or early 1942. While the prisoners were being whipped, the disciple 
      lost his control and uttered a Qabalistic formula to immobilize the torturers. 
      However, the effects of the formula were eventually canceled and the disciple 
      was shot as revenge. Adolf Hitler offered Bardon high positions in the Third 
      Reich under the condition that he help win the war with his magick. Bardon 
      was further expected to reveal to Hitler the address of the other 98 of 
      the 99 Lodges spread all over the world. When he refused to help, the Nazis 
      cruelly tortured him. Among other things, they performed operations on Bardon 
      without anesthesia, and forged iron rings around his ankles and fixed heavy 
      iron balls to them. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the war 
      Bardon found, with the help of his magick abilities, that Hitler had escaped 
      abroad. For fear of recognition, Hitler had undergone several of surgical 
      operations on his face. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dieter Ruggeberg(publisher 
      of Bardon's books) makes this comment on the above statements: "So much 
      for Otti Votavova's recital of facts. In the years of my acquaintance with 
      her I was able to convince myself of her love of truth." </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After regaining 
      his freedom, Bardon recommenced his occult work and healing. It was apparently 
      this last work that got him in trouble with the Czech authorities. They 
      strongly discouraged this type of thing in the very repressive political 
      climate of postwar Czechoslovakia. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Arrest and Death</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding Bardon's 
      last years, Ruggeberg wrote to me as follows: "The profession of Bardon 
      was natural healer. He was able to cure cancer until the 2nd degree, without 
      steel and rays, only with his own medicine made from plants and treated 
      with alchemical means. For this reason the doctors of the official medicine 
      became very jealous, because they could not reach such success with their 
      chemical and nuclear treatments. After the publication of his books in 1956, 
      a number of people came from Germany to visit him. The doctors took this 
      opportunity to accuse Bardon to be a spy from the West, and that was the 
      reason he was arrested in 1958 in Opava, Czechoslovakia." Russian Communist 
      ideologies, thus they persecuted free-thinkers, Gypsies, Jews, Freemasons 
      and anyone interested in the occult or esoteric subjects. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon died 
      July 10th, 1958. What connection, if any, his death had with the arrest 
      I have been unable to determine. If he was a professional stage magician 
      in Germany in the 1920's and 1930's, we could assume that he was born roughly 
      around the turn of the century, and thus would not have been very old at 
      his death. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Fraternity of 
      Saturn</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon stoutly 
      maintained that he was not a member of, nor under any obligations to a magickal 
      lodge or order. However, some sources indicate that he was actually a member 
      of the Fraternity of Saturn, an important occult lodge which flourished 
      in Germany in the early part of the 20th Century. During the ascent of the 
      Nazi party, they closed or persecuted all Masonic, religious and occult 
      organizations. They closed and banned the Fraternity of Saturn Lodge sometime 
      between 1933 and 1937, but it was revived in 1950. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have not 
      yet been able to positively identify Bardon as a member of the Fraternity 
      of Saturn. While recognizing the power and validity of sex magick, Bardon 
      emphatically discourages the student from dabbling in it until he understands 
      its full implications. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Franz Bardon's Writings</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each book follows 
      a roughly similar pattern: a mainly theoretical exposition followed by practical 
      instruction. Reading and understanding them is a challenge, as they have 
      been translated from German-and possibly from Czechoslovakian before that-into 
      non-idiomatic English. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Translational 
      difficulties aside, one thing that makes an enduring impression is Bardon's 
      evident sincerity. He insists frequently that he is doing as much as possible 
      to transmit a system of occult development to the serious student who is 
      either unable to find a teacher or work in a group. In line with this, he 
      also frequently reiterates that he has personally performed such and such 
      an experiment, ritual or procedure. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> His Sources</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before describing 
      some of Bardon's theories, it is good to keep in mind that many of the words 
      he uses have different meanings in a mundane context and even in other occult 
      systems. Impregnation, fluid, condenser, sphere - all have special meanings. 
      </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For instance, 
      Bardon appears to have originated the concept of the so-called "fluid condenser." 
      "Fluids" are magickal qualities, not fluids as we understand them in daily 
      life, and are divided into "electric" and "magnetic" types. A "condenser" 
      is a magick wand, mirror, or other device the magician crafts to "condense", 
      or concentrate, these fluids. An example of preparing a fluid condenser 
      is given later in this article. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of his 
      occult ideas can be traced to earlier works, such as Eliphas Levi and Barrett's 
      The Magus. Bardon also seems to have been familiar with Tibetan occultism, 
      or at any rate the works of Alexandria David-Neel, whom he cites now and 
      then, and from whom he does a fair amount of borrowing. He mentions, for 
      example, kylichors(magickal diagrams), and tum-mo (the ability of Tibetan 
      adepts to stay warm in freezing weather). The mental exercises Bardon prescribes, 
      such as one-pointedness, watching the roaming of consciousness and so on, 
      are commonplace in yogic and other occult works. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Bardon 
      does not mention Crowley or any of his writings, "The Beast's" influence 
      is present. Compare Crowley's famous dictum: "Love is the law, love under 
      will" to Bardon's: "Love is the law, but love under a strong will." </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bardon's Theories: 
      The Magickal Universe</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon postulates 
      an energetic model of the universe modified from Far Eastern theories, including 
      Taoism and Hindu cosmology. His "electric" and "magnetic" fluids compliment 
      each other in the same way that Yin and Yang do. These are clearly not the 
      physicist's forces by the same names, but there is a certain analogy between 
      them. "Magnetism" is a cool, negative force with a blue emanation; and "electricity" 
      is a warm, positive force with a red emanation. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Initiation 
      Into Hermetics Bardon refers once to the "OR" and "OB" forces. My guess 
      is that these might represent the "Red"(OR = "Odyle Rot") and "Blue" (Odyle 
      Blau") or electric and magnetic fluids. Or perhaps they are adaptations 
      of the OD and OB forces described in Eliphas Levi's Transcendental Magic. 
      Whatever the scientific validity of this approach, it is certainly rich 
      with suggestive possibilities. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon's "od" 
      or "odyle" energy, which Baron Karl von Reichenbach originally developed 
      in the mid-1800's. The negative pole of a magnet, he claimed, appeared blue 
      to persons with high psychic sensitivity and induced a feeling of coldness. 
      The positive pole appeared red and had the property of warmth. He elaborated 
      this theory into a highly complex system of occult anatomy and mysticism. 
      Bardon usually called od "vital power" ["lebenskraft"], but once or twice 
      reverts to the term "od." </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon teaches 
      that each part of the body is governed by either the electric or the magnetic 
      force, or it may be neutral. Disease is caused by parts being out of balance. 
      </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Four Elements</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon made 
      use of the ancient four elements - Fire, Earth, Air and Water - plus Akasha, 
      or Quintessence. His attributions of the elements are essentially the same 
      as those in other systems and books.: Water for emotions, intuition; Fire 
      for aggressiveness, passion, etc. In his view, the skillful magician was 
      one who could manipulate the Elements to achieve desired effects. Of course, 
      before the student could become master of the Elements, he had to harmonize 
      and control the manifestations of all Elements in his own being. </font> 
    </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon taught 
      that man was superior to all spirits, demons and angels in that only man 
      was a "four-pole" being - that is, combining the energies of all the Elements 
      . For instance, gnomes are strictly creatures of Earth, sylphs of Air and 
      so forth. He cautioned the student to beware of tricks and deceptions on 
      the parts of these creatures, who wished to capture a part of the human's 
      soul. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Bardon's 
      words: "Any deliberate cause, may be such as a wish, a thought or any imagination 
      created in this sphere together with the dynamic concentration of willpower, 
      unshaken faith and fullest conviction is bound to be realized with the help 
      of the elements... . "Consciousness knows neither time nor space, and is 
      therefore an akasha principle. He also instructs the student to re-dissolve 
      the akasha into the universe rather than keep it accumulated. In other words, 
      the "magickal" frame of mind should not be the same as the everyday one. 
      </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Preparation of the 
      Student</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A pillar of 
      Bardon's method is the point that the magician must be balanced in the Elements 
      that make up his own being. A student with an excess or lack of any Element 
      could not achieve great success, no matter how much work he does. An analogy 
      would be an auto engine: no matter how much fuel you feed to it, it can 
      only generate so much if it is not properly tuned and balanced. After a 
      point, the engine will either wear out quickly or fail if you attempt to 
      make it perform beyond its limits. The difference with humans is that our 
      limits are self-imposed. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon also 
      insists on the point that the student begin at the beginning and not skip 
      any section of his training. The student must completely master each step 
      before proceeding on to the next. Again, the analogy to other endeavors 
      is clear. If magick is a skill like flying, then the student cannot neglect 
      the study of airplanes, weather, safety, avionics and so forth, without 
      serious difficulties in the future. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, as 
      many teachers say, the student must keep a complete and accurate record. 
      Without this, it is hard to repeat successes and avoid repeating mistakes. 
      </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Outline of Bardon's 
      Magickal Curriculum</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Bardon 
      divides his praxis into ten steps, these are somewhat arbitrary. Here is 
      a summary of his main points: </font> </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. Self-Analysis 
        &amp; Basic Exercises</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As mentioned 
        above, the student must work diligently on understanding and harmonizing 
        the four Elements within his own being before doing any further occult 
        work. Bardon prescribes several weeks of minute, mercilessly honest self-observation 
        and recording of one's faults and failings. The student classifies each 
        under the four Elemental categories to see which Elements are out of balance 
        in his Self. A similar exercise classifies his virtues and strengths. 
        Since the magician is to have control over all the Elemental worlds, he 
        must not be unbalanced or have any obsessions that would impede his effectiveness, 
        or allow weak spots that could cause his undoing.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. Intermediate 
        Concentration &amp; Breathing</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the 
        next step, the student strengthens his ability to concentrate and performs 
        breathing exercises and the techniques of autosuggestion. Bardon regards 
        these as the secret key to the subconscious.</font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bardon 
        distinguishes carefully between two kinds of breathing: Pulmonary (normal) 
        and through the skin. This second type of breathing takes practice. The 
        body can respire automatically, but the student needs to learn to control 
        it, combine it with voluntary pulmonary breathing and selectively inspire 
        the various Elements and Akasha.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. Advanced 
        Visualization Exercises &amp; Element Manipulation</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This step 
        entails intense concentration on and visualization of increasingly more 
        complex objects, and "inhaling" the Elements into the body. The student 
        also learns the "loading," or charging, of talismans, rooms, or objects 
        for protection, healing, or other purposes.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4. Accumulation 
        of Elements &amp; Rituals</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In this 
        part of the training the student, works to perfect the balancing and concentrating 
        of Elementary energies in the students own and other persons's bodies. 
        In Bardon's system, "rituals" are mot what we normally think of as such, 
        but rather mnemonics based on hand gestures, verbal formulas or visual 
        keys. He claims that once you understand the energies properly, can recall 
        an energy or situation with merely a surreptitious hand gesture, a silent 
        formula or a combination thereof.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5. Transplanting 
        Consciousness &amp; Levitation</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This step 
        consists of a graduated series of exercises to prepare the student for 
        physical and astral levitation and astral travel, as a prelude to communication 
        with astral beings. Communication with the astral world can either be 
        active or passive. Passive techniques are simpler and safer, thus Bardon 
        presents them first.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6. Introduction 
        to Astral Beings &amp; Astral Travel</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Besides 
        astral beings and travel, this chapter deals with the creation of non-physical 
        beings for the magician's use. Bardon also discusses the perils of accidentally 
        creating them. This inadvertent creation of phantasms which can attach 
        to and parasitize the operator is a great danger for the dabbler in occultism. 
        At this point, Bardon again insists that the student not skip any step 
        in his development, in order to avoid this serious problem.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. Development 
        of Clairvoyance, Clairaudience &amp; Other Abilities:</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Creation 
        of Elementaries</font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bardon 
        gives formulas for accessories such as special eye-baths and ear-plugs 
        to aid in development of supersensory perception. He also discusses magick 
        animation of pictures and statues.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>8. "Fluid 
        Condensers"</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> These are 
        special tools which the magician creates to concentrate, store, and manipulate 
        the electric and magnetic fluids. He gives fairly detailed instructions 
        for making, charging and using these "condensers."</font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> First, 
        Bardon teaches that even minute quantities gold can add enormously to 
        the accumulative power of any condenser. Thus, he recommends preparing 
        a gold tincture to "charge" any condensers the student makes. The easiest 
        way is to dissolve a gram of soluble gold chloride in 20 grams of distilled 
        water. (Gold chloride is fairly expensive - about $50 per gram.)</font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here is 
        an interesting example of Bardon's condensers: Put a handful of fresh 
        or dry chamomile flowers into a pot. Pour enough cold water over them 
        to cover them completely. Let the chamomile flowers boil for about 20 
        minutes. Cool them, but leave the lid on the pot and strain the decoction. 
        Put this on the fire again and allow it to evaporate slowly until it weighs 
        about 50 grams. A few drops more or less do not matter at all. Let the 
        extract cool and, for better preservation, mix it with the same quantity 
        (in this case 50 grams) of spirit or alcohol. (Remember to never use methyl 
        or wood alcohol in any preparation meant to be used in or on the body.) 
        To this mixture add about 10 drops of the gold tincture prepared above.</font></dd>

        continues:</font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you 
        wish to use the condenser for your own purposes, you may still strengthen 
        it, by adding a drop of your blood or sperm, if possible both together, 
        on a swab of cotton wool, throw this afterwards without any scruples into 
        the condenser and shake the lot well. Then, pour all, in a funnel, through 
        filter paper or linen into a small bottle and keep it well corked in a 
        cool and dark place, ready to use.</font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The magician 
        can use these condensers in many ways: mixing them with liquids to drink, 
        for anointing, mixing them with incense compounds, or pouring them in 
        small bowls to collect and concentrate certain energies.</font></dd>
      <dd><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Any fluid 
        condenser which has been prepared in this manner does not lose its efficiency 
        even after many years. The condenser must be well shaken each time you 
        are going to use it, the bottle is to be corked again after withdrawing 
        some out of it. In the same way you can prepare several universal condensers 
        from Russian or genuine Chinese tea, from lily-blossoms-best are the white 
        ones-popular leaves, alraune roots or mandragora roots, arnica montana, 
        acacia flowers. Any simple fluid condenser, prepared from one plant is 
        sufficient for normal use such as influencing through the elements, or 
        developing the astral senses by means of the fluid condensers.</font></dd>

        Bardon lists many ways the magician can use it. He describes treatment

    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An amazing book on 
      Communicating with Spirits</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon's second 
      published work, The Practice of Magical Evocation, is a remarkable and unique 
      work of nearly 500 pages. The first of its two parts is an exhaustive description 
      of the many tools and apparatus the magician needs to work. The topics he 
      treats include: The Magick Circle, Triangle, Censer, Mirror, Lamp, Wand, 
      Sword, Dagger, Trident, Crown, Cap and Magus-Band. This book is much more 
      ceremonially oriented than the first, which requires a minimum of apparatus. 
      The Practice of Magical Evocation is a classic magickal grimoire, or instruction 
      manual - probably one of the best ever written. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second 
      part of of the book is a huge catalog of spirits or entities that the student 
      is supposed to be able to contact after perfecting the techniques in the 
      first book. A short paragraph accompanies most of the entries explaining 
      the the specialty or purpose of the being and what skills, knowledge or 
      advantage it can bring the occult practitioner. Bardon states several times 
      that he has contacted all these entities himself and is writing what he 
      knows in the first person. In fact, he says there are many more entities 
      he has omitted, because of their unsuitability for beginners. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The names of 
      these spirits are quite interesting. A few of them are the same as the corresponding 
      names in the "classical" magickal tradition. His "72 spirits of the Mercury 
      sphere" are exactly the 72 angels of the Schem-ha-mephorash. Some of them 
      are oddly changed. For instance, "osrail" is clearly the same as "Azrael," 
      and Opollogon" appears to correspond to "Apollyon." These spirits are described 
      in Barrett's The Magus, among other books. The changes in spelling may be 
      due to the fact that Bardon originally wrote in Czechoslovakian or German. 
      However, most of his other spirits I have been unable to trace. For instance, 
      here are some of the spirits of the Mars sphere, none of which I can locate 
      in other references: Rarum, Gibsir, Rahol, and Adica. These names may be 
      from an obscure medieval grimoire, have different meanings in Czechoslovakian, 
      or have some relation to his own Qabalistic system - but so far I have been 
      unable to make such a connection. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bardon's Unique Qabalistic 
      System</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the second 
      book, the coherence and organization of Bardon's work deteriorates noticeably. 
      His third published work was The Key to the True Qabalah. His Qabalistic 
      system depends on the sounds of the various letters of the alphabet. It's 
      not clear that this was exhaustively thought out, since there are many alphabets 
      in use (even among Western languages). Hebrew, Cyrillic and Arabic all have 
      different alphabets, and some (Chinese) have no alphabet at all. He uses 
      his Qabala somewhat differently than other occultists: he connects Qabalistic 
      formulae to various processes (e.g., a vibration consisting of the sounds 
      "KTM" is a formula to load a room for protections, "AAQ" is used for remote 
      healing, etc.). </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon also 
      uses his Qabalah as sort of shorthand: once the occultist has made contact 
      with some planetary intelligence, for instance, he can re-contact the intelligence 
      by using its "phone number" for simplicity. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Later Books of Rough 
      Quality</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is clear 
      that after the first two books, much less time or assistance was available 
      for Bardon to get his work in print. Perhaps he was incarcerated or dead 
      and unable to to help with the editing. In any case, Bardon's production 
      after this point declined rapidly. The next book was Frabato the Magician 
      for which Bardon only had notes. In the English edition, the publisher added 
      extensive notes to indicate that the book (and appended material) is, in 
      essence, Bardon's unedited notes. However, this is an intriguing occult 
      novel somewhat along the lines of those of Dion Fortune. </font> </p>
    <h3> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a NAME="milligan"></a>Franz 
      Bardon Today</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few years 
      ago, an enthusiastic student started the "Franz Bardon Foundation" in Denver, 
      Colorado. He showed his devotion to the "Magus Guru", as he called Bardon, 
      by changing his name to "<b>Jim Bardon</b>." For a time, I subscribed to 
      this newsletter, which was 4 or 8 pages and issued a few time a year. The 
      newsletter was, I am sure, a sincere effort and often had interesting and 
      useful ideas. Unfortunately, it also included much peripheral material that 
      seemed to have no direct connection with Bardon's works. Each issue repeated 
      much of the same information about: Jim Bardon's" predictions of major recessions 
      and at least one world war between 1989 and 2005. I'm not sure if the recent 
      Persian Gulf war would qualify. There is nothing in Franz Bardon's own writings 
      that would support these theories. Furthermore, Jim Bardon, in his bulletins 
      also advertised his own publications, astrological service and hermetic 
      training. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I lost contact 
      with him when he raised the yearly subscription for his newsletter from 
      $25.00 to $50.00 - in order, he said, to separate the sincere from the frivolous. 
      Apparently Mr. Bardon's Foundation is still in existence. A classified ad 
      in a recent issue of Llewellyn's New Times gives a phone number for it in 
      Seattle, Washington. </font></p>

    <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Summary of Franz Bardon 
      and Editorial</font></h3>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps it 
      is unfair to make such comparisons, but it is interesting to contrast Franz 
      Bardon's works with those of the of the other great magickal teacher of 
      the century, Aleister Crowley. Although when the spirit moved him, Crowley 
      could be intensely disciplined, kind and helpful to his students and magnanimous, 
      he also enjoyed a life filled with sex, drugs, alcohol and bon vivant - 
      all of which are integral parts of his magickal philosophy. Crowley was 
      continually heaping praise on himself, excoriating those he felt were beneath 
      him, discarding students as unworthy, and continuously justifying his behavior. 
      He praised strength and sneered at weakness. Crowley's writing are full 
      of literary practical jokes, insults to the reader's intelligence, and deliberate 
      deceptions. </font> </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon represented 
      almost everything that Crowley was not. He appeared to be patient, devout, 
      non-judgmental and earnest. He insisted that only through balance and purging 
      of excesses could one achieve success in magick. And (though this probably 
      reflects my personal biases), it seems that Bardon's reticence and cautionary 
      tone concerning sexual magick is a much more reasonable attitude than Crowley's, 
      especially for beginners. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certainly not 
      one occultist in a thousand has made good use of sex magick, whereas an 
      unfortunately large number have become obsessed, or worse. How many people 
      have you heard of who have improved themselves through sex magick? But it's 
      certainly a heck of a lot more fun than the drudgery of discipline. Similar 
      observations apply to students whose magickal work revolves around the use 
      of intoxicants and narcotics. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I feel that 
      Bardon does deliver what he promises: detailed magickal instruction for 
      the diligent and serious student who, for whatever reason, cannot or will 
      not attach to a magickal order or group. It is sometimes a challenge to 
      penetrate the mediocre translations of his works, but with supplementary 
      magickal study things do become clear. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
