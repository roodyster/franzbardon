<P>by Edward James</P>

<P>The appearance of this important work should serve to awaken renewed, and  

intelligent interest in the often discussed area of sexual magic in the Western 

 tradition. On a more technical note, it reveals a clear relationship between  

Randolph's works and the writings of Franz Bardon. Fluid and solid condensers,  

flashing colors, and a complex use of magical mirrors were seldom, if ever,  

mentioned in occult literature in the eighty or more years dividing the two  

writers.</P>

<P>It is also of interest to note the possible relationship between PBR, as he 

 was known to his friends, and the emergence of the O.T.O., O.T.O.A., and lesser

  known magical orders, having Templar and Masonic involvements. John Yarker, a 

 British Masonic leader, who held numerous documents giving him the

authorization   to grant charters for a number of Hermetic, Masonic and Templar

type Lodges,   granted a charter for the formation of a Templar Order to Karl

Kellner, about   the year 1887. Occult historian Francis King believed that

these charters came   into Yarker's hands through the United States from France.</P>

<P>The America - England connection can easily be explained when we consider  

the fact that PBR traveled frequently between the U.S., France, and England. He,

  in fact, by 1870, had established the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor in both  

England and Europe, along with a small circle of initiates in France who  

practiced almost exclusively his socio-sexual dictates for magical living as  

indicated in his work Eulis and other instructional novels. The German  

historian, Karl R. H. Frick, suggests that President Lincoln, General A. H.  

Hitchcock, and other notable Americans were members of the Brotherhood of Eulis,

  or the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, during the period embracing the Civil 

war.  In England and Europe, Francois Dumas (son of author Alexander Dumas), 

Eliphas  Levi, Kenneth Mackenzie, and Hargrave Jennings were considered students

 of his  teachings. It is held that Madame Blavatsky was a member of his

Hermetic   Brotherhood of Luxor but later became a life-long antagonist of PBR

over the   issue of secrecy in the presentation of occult truths to the masses.</P>

<P>It is believed that a document giving in a practical form much of PBR's  

sexual practices was in circulation among the German magical circles as early as

  1868. These practices were most likely passed to Karl Kellner in 1895 when he 

 received a charter to form the O.T.O. In 1912, after the death of Kellner,  

Theodor Reuss assumed leadership of the Order, but it is unclear if the  

practical sexual magical materials were passed to him. Reuss, along with  

Hartmann and Klein were given a charter in 1902 to establish the Grand Lodge of 

 the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis and Mizraim from John Yarker. This  

charter appeared not to have been successfully managed and little is known of  

this reformed Order until it appeared to be associated with the O.T.O.A. in  

Spain in the 1920's.</P>

<P>It is reported that Encausse gave a charter for the O.T.O. to function in  

Haiti in 1910. This Order was created in December of 1921, and appeared to have 

 the sexual practices of PBR, and contain additional Gnostic and Voodoo sexual  

rites. This Order, it is reported, continues to exist both in Haiti and Europe, 

 and had issued an American charter in the recent past. R. Swinburne Clymer, one

  of the founders of the American Rosicrucian movement, based his philosophy  

directly on PBR's teachings. Certain Black churches of Chicago base their  

methods directly on magical healing and related rites used and introduced into  

their ministry by PBR.</P>

<P>One could cite other contributions of this man to the growth and functioning

  of the Western Magical Tradition - this is not our aim. We hope that someone

in   the near future researches and presents to us the story of his life and

times  in  a full length work. To all of us students of the Hermetic Way, Pascal

 Beverly  Randolph has left his favorite affirmation - Try! New York City April

<H2>Foreword </H2>

<P>by Robert North</P>

<P>	The circumstances of my translation and study of Sexual Magic have been  

rather unusual and so I will attempt to recount them as accurately as possible.<BR>In

  the summer of 1987, I was living in the city of Providence, Rhode Island; that

  demon-haunted metropolis favored by Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft in  

earlier times. Years before, I had heard rumors of the magical teachings of P.B.

  Randolph. But the only evidence that I had been able to discover was a 1939  

reprint of Ravolette. This proved to be a rather slow novel, in the florid style

  of the nineteenth century, with a long, elaborate introduction by a seemingly 

 right-wing Christian occultist of doubtful literary talents and even more  

doubtful perceptions. Consequently, I left Randolph for the more stimulating  

company of Aleister Crowley and Franz Bardon.</P>

<P>By the summer of 1987, I considered myself well versed in the western  

magical tradition. Some twenty years of continuous study of Agrippa, Dee, Levi, 

 the Golden Dawn, the O.T.O., Bardon, A.O. Spare, Gardner, Voudoun, and Tantra  

had led me to believe that I had attained to a real understanding of Magick. It 

 was summer and time for a vacation. Montreal, Canada was suggested and it

seemed   like a good idea. Our journey to Montreal was wonderful, stopping to

mine   Herkimer &quot;diamonds&quot; (quartz crystals) only a few miles from the

  original site of the Oneida Commune and passing through Gamet Hill in the  

Adirondacks, where abandoned Gamet mines still yielded a few glistening  

treasures.</P>

<P>On arriving in Montreal, I attempted to contact several addresses of &quot;magickal&quot;

  persons that I had obtained ten years previously. None of them still resided

in   Montreal. On the third day of my visit, my companion told me, &quot;You

must   become intuitive and calm if you would attract the adepti. &quot;

Consequently,   in a passive, meditative state, I strolled down Rue St. Denis, a

potpourri of   sidewalk cafes and boutiques, reminiscent of Paris. After a time,

I looked   across the street and saw a sign reading &quot;Cafe Theleme.&quot; My

companion   remarked, &quot;It must be a Greek restaurant,&quot; but we examined

the   premises and found it to be a veritable Temple of Magical Wisdom.</P>

<P>This was the beginning of an initiatory experience of which I cannot give  

many details, but suffice it to say that a certain book was delivered into my  

hands.<BR>This book was, of course, Magia Sexualis by Pascal Beverly Randolph. 

 It was entirely in French and I was charged with the task of bringing this work

  to the English speaking world.<BR>The events surrounding my translation were 

 quite mysterious. I met many brothers on the magical path. Some were secretive 

 and seemingly uncooperative. Yet others were cordial and marvelously helpful.  

Most of all, it seemed as if Randolph's spirit was continually present, both  

guiding and restraining.<BR>Perhaps the greatest mystery of the book was the  

language that it was written in. The printed edition that I had was published by

  Guy Le Prat of Paris. It purported to be a French translation by a certain 

Maria  de Naglowska of an English original by Randolph. However, repeated 

letters to  the publisher and translator resulted only in a terse response that 

they  possessed only the French translation and thought that the English 

original must  be available in the U.S.<BR>This response felt like a deliberate

 blind. As my  translation progressed, I became increasingly aware of the 

distinctly nineteenth  century French style of the prose. Certain puns in the 

French appeared.  [example: in chapter X, the second page, &quot;it also comes 

toward god and  perfection&quot;: comes was my translation for the French &quot;&ecirc;lancer&quot;,

  meaning &quot;to throb, to twinge; to rush, spring, dash; to spurt out.&quot; 

 This passage refers to the divine nature of the orgasm. Either Maria de  

Naglowska was an incredibly inventive translator or&#151;this was the French of 

 Pascal Beverly!) Another interesting discovery was a definite change of style

in   the section on Magnetic Mirrors. The commonly used expressions are

different  and  the Mirrors section speaks in metric terms of millimeters rather

than the  inches  and feet that are dealt with in the earlier three sections.

Moreover,  the  narrator speaks of New York and then speaks of things also

happening &quot;in   this country&quot; (France?) in Chapter XIX, tenth page.<BR>On

completing my   translation, I could not help but conclude that I was

translating the French of   PBR! It is not inconceivable that he would have

written of the &quot;forbidden&quot;   subjects of sex and drugs in French to

confound his American detractors. In   fact, I am led to theorize that Randolph

wrote the first three sections in   French while in America. The final section

on Magnetic Mirrors must have been a   lecture given in Paris, hence the change

in style.</P>

<P>Furthermore, I must conclude that one person in 1981 could not have  

translated this book from English into French. The changes in style, the puns  

and the literary style render this highly unlikely. While I cannot offer  

absolute proof for my theories, I feel that I am justified in my suspicions. So,

  once again, mystery surrounds the image of Pascal Beverly Randolph. Perhaps it

  should be so. For if the magician seeks to become the microcosm of life, of

that   great macrocosm of all manifestation, should he not be clothed in

mystery?</P>

<H2>Introduction to the Life and Work of Pascal Beverly Randolph</H2>

<P>Of all the magicians, philosophers and poets of the nineteenth century,  

there can be no more mysterious figure than Pascal Beverly Randolph. He was  

famous in his own .time for his novels and his theoretical treatises in pioneer 

 areas of medicine and psychology. He numbered among his friends such persons as

  Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon III, Eliphas Levi, Lord Bulwer-Lytton, Charles

Mackay   and other notables of the day.<BR>Yet, he veiled himself in such

impenetrable   secrecy, that almost nothing about him can be stated as fact. A

wealth of myth   and legend surrounds this intriguing man, whose personal life

was so complex and   habits so secretive, that we may only guess at the story of

his career.  Randolph  published over twenty books in his lifetime and speaks of

his life in  many of  them. But almost everything he wrote was coded in such a

way that it  could be  understood on several levels.<BR>If Pascal's life had a

theme, it was  Love. His  personal motto was &quot;Try&quot; and he signed at

least one of his  photographs  &quot;Stand for the Right! &quot; He was an

advocate of women's  rights long  before it was a popular stance and he was a

real pioneer in sexual  therapy. He  held a strong belief in supernatural forces

and was outspoken in  his desire to  investigate such things scientifically.<BR>Yet

throughout his  life, PBR was  persecuted for his progressive thinking as well

as for his mixed  racial  heritage.</P>

<P>Pascal Beverly Randolph was born on October 8, 1825 at #70 Canal Street in  

New York City to Flora Beverly and Edmund Randolph. 1 It seems unlikely that his

  famous father was in attendance or, for that matter, ever met him.<BR>Edmund 

 Randolph had been the Governor of Virginia and attended the constitutional  

convention during the birth of the United States. He had served as  

Attorney-General in Washington's first cabinet and in 1794, Secretary of State. 

 2<BR>Flora Beverly may have been a black princess from Madagascar or a native 

 American from Vermont. Whatever the truth of the matter, her marriage with  

Randolph was short lived and she was left to raise little Pascal by herself. PBR

  describes her in glowing loving terms as a seeress, a dreamer and a beauty. 3<BR>She

  raised her son in a &quot;large, somber and gloomy old stone house on

Manhattan   Island&quot; 4 and one imagines that she may have lulled him to

sleep at night   with many strange and fantastic stories. This may have been the

source for the   legend of Dhoula Bel, the King and the Stranger, 5 a story

which Randolph held   to be of supreme importance throughout his life. Her

melancholia and longing for   his father may have been the motivation for his

never ending crusade against   abusive marriages, common in the nineteenth

century.<BR>&quot;She loved him as   the apple of her eye&quot; 6 until, in

Pascal's fifth year, she died from an   epidemic&#151;yellow fever, smallpox,

cholera; there were many in those times of   pestilence. The event had a

tremendous impact on the boy and a few years later,   in the orphanage where he

was placed, young Pascal had visions of his mother   returning from the dead.

She told him, &quot;Let thy motto be&#151;Try! Despond   not, but ever remember

that how bitter soever our lot may be, that despite it   all WE MAY BE HAPPY

YET!&quot; 7 On one occasion he and several other children   witnessed a

materialization of his mother's form as well as poltergeist   activity.<BR>&quot;From

his father our hero inherited little save a lofty   spirit&quot; 8 and Pascal

was left to grow up on his own. He taught himself how   to read and write,

copying letters from printed posters and billboards. 9 At   eight years of age

he was christened in the Roman Catholic church with the name   of Beverly.</P>

<P>It must have been a hard life for a parentless child in 1830's New England. 

 In 1837, at the age of twelve, Randolph shipped aboard the brig &quot;Phoebe&quot;

  in New Bedford as a cabin boy. 10 This was the beginning of a life at sea that

  lasted for eight years&#151;a period that Randolph would remember as miserable

  and painful.<BR>But the life of a sailor is an education in many things, and 

 when PBR finally came ashore, he was a wiser and stronger man for his  

experience. During his time at sea, he was bullied and no doubt teased about his

  mixed blood. His health often suffered, yet he was not beyond playing a prank 

or  two himself on his shipmates, such as substituting a laxative for a prized  

bottle of rum or spilling hot grease on his tormentors.&quot;<BR>At sea, he  

heard many tales of the supernatural during the long watches and his interest in

  things occult was firmly established. Sea duty took him all over the world and

  Randolph learned bits of many languages, even becoming fluent in French. It

was   a brutal, but international education.</P>

<P>Finally, at twenty, PBR injured himself in a wood chopping 12 accident and  

found himself unable to work aboard ship. He came ashore once and for all and,  

as many sailors have done, wandered aimlessly for several years, seeking his  

true path.<BR>The year that Randolph came ashore, 1848, was the time of the  

famous Hydesville rappings, which gave birth to the nineteenth century phenomena

  of Spiritualism. In Hydesville, New York, three sisters named Fox claimed to

be   in communication with the spirits of the dead. It was widely publicized and

 soon  the possibility of communication with the dead became one of the most 

widely  discussed topics of the day.<BR>Randolph, like many of his 

contemporaries, was  fascinated with the subject and studied it intensely. He 

also studied the  doctrines of a Viennese doctor, Franz Anton Mesmer. This was 

the study of animal  magnetism, or mesmerism, which involved making magnetic 

passes with the hands  around the patient's body and the use of a large bath tub

 containing bottles  filled with magnetized water and iron filings, from which 

protruded iron bars  which patients would hold to receive a magnetic charge. 

Mesmer's theories of  magnetism and polarity deeply influenced Randolph, who 

would later expound his  own theories of fluid condensers and volts.<BR>After 

four years of wandering,  we find PBR working as a barber in either New York 

City or a rural New England  village, as the case may be. 13 He began speaking 

before small groups of people  on the subject of spiritualism and most likely 

acted as a medium. However, he  eventually condemned mediumistic practices and 

consequently alienated many of  his followers. Or, as he put it, &quot;ten 

thousand daggers were leveled at his  heart, ten thousand tongues defamed him.&quot;

 14 This was a great turning point  in his life for at this time, it seems, 

Randolph became convinced that the  supernatural must be studied scientifically 

and this remained the central theme  of his work for the rest of his life. He 

turned his attention to the study of  medicine and the making of elixirs.<BR>His

 medical education remains rather  shadowy, but in 1854 PBR set up a medical 

practice on Boylston Street in Boston  and appended M.D. to his name. 15 He kept

 an alchemical laboratory in his  offices and manufactured several elixirs

there.  The most popular was called  Protozone, which replenished &quot;the

waste of  vitality in the human system&quot;  and had wonderful &quot;power over

morbid  states of mind and body.&quot; 16 He  also seems to have run a small

publishing  business from his offices.<BR>His  medical practice led him to

experiment with  consciousness altering drugs&#151;opium,  belladonna and many

others. He also  began to speak out on issues of sexuality.  His candid and open

views on these  two issues, drugs and sex, drew much  criticism and resulted in

persecution from  many quarters in later years.  However, for some eighteen

years, PBR enjoyed a  great deal of success.</P>

<P>In 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Dr. Randolph visited  

California, where he lectured for ten weeks on Rosicrucian doctrine and  

established the first Rosicrucian Lodge in that state. After this, Randolph  

departed for foreign shores, &quot;traveling through England, Scotland, Ireland,

  France, Malta, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Turkey, Greece, and other  

countries &quot; 17<BR>In his writings he hints that he received high  

initiations into the Grand Dome of the Rosicrucians in Paris. He visited the  

famous French mage, Eliphas Levi and reports that in 1861, he participated in  

secret Rosicrucian rites with Napoleon III and Eliphas Levi.18 While on this  

trip he compiled material for his famous work, Pre-Adamite Man, dedicated to  

Abraham Lincoln, rumored to be a close friend. 19<BR>On his return to Boston,  

PBR offered his services to the US government and raised a regiment of Black  

Union soldiers, known as the &quot;Fremont Legion.&quot; 20 Presumably in reward

  for this action, President Lincoln sent him to Louisiana, where he was later  

appointed Principal of the Lincoln Memorial High Grade and Normal School, a  

school for freed slaves. 21 During this time, Randolph witnessed and studied the

  &quot;Rites of the Black Voudeux&quot; 22.<BR>In July 1866, PBR returned to 

the  Northern States to raise money for his school. He lectured throughout New  

England and made a bid for a career in politics at the Philadelphia Convention  

of Southern Loyalists. But it seems that even the post-war North was not ready  

for this politician of color. Randolph grow disgusted with politics and returned

  to his practice of medicine and publishing ventures in Boston. 23<BR>Randolph's

  method of attaining spiritual knowledge was known as the sleep of Sialam, or  

shiloam. Shiloam, from the Hebrew Shiloah (literally, sending forth), was a  

spring outside Jerusalem mentioned in the Bible (John IX.7). 24 Randolph would  

fall into a trance and experience visions. This method was probably developed  

during his spiritualistic period, although he referred to it as a Tibetan  

method.<BR></P>

<P>During his journeys to Paris, Pascal became aware of several works which  

were being published in France and Germany dealing with the Ansaireth or  

Nusairis of Syria. 25 There was much discussion, in the Rosicrucian circles that

  Randolph traveled in, of the purity and sublimity of the teachings of the  

Ansaireh. Books by Niebuhr, M. Catafago, Victor Langlois and others told of  

these mysterious hill dwellers in Northern Syria who were neither Jews,  

Christians or Muslims. They may well have been the people that modern  

anthropology has identified as the Yezidi, the devotees of the Peucock god,  

Melek Ta'aus.<BR>PBR tells how the chief of the Ansaireth, Narek El Gebel,  

arrived at the Rosicrucian Third Dome in Paris with letters of introduction and 

 then, recognizing Randolph's abilities and character, invited him to come to  

Syria and to study with the Ansaireth. Randolph went to Syria and was initiated 

 into the Ansairetic Brotherhood. Upon his return to America, he established the

  Priesthood of Aeth based on the Ansairetic Mysteries. 26 <BR>Another account 

 credits PBR with undergoing initiation in the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, 27

  a secret society that H.P. Blavatsky and Karl Kellner both claimed initiation 

 into. It remains open to question, however, whether these initiations took

place   on the physical or the mental plane.<BR>The following is quoted from

one of   Randolph's last books, Eulis. It is highly significant as the

confession of a   man, believing himself to be at death's door, concerning the

origins of his   teachings.<BR>&quot;Very nearly all that I have given as

Rosicrucianism   originated in my soul; and scarce a single thought, only

suggestions, have I   borrowed from those who, in ages past, called themselves

by that name&#151;one   which served me well as a vehicle wherein to take my

mental treasure to a   market, which gladly opened its doors to that name, but

would, and did, slam to   its portals in the face of the tawny student of

esoterics.<BR>&quot;Precisely   so was it with things purporting to be

Ansairetic. I had merely read Lydde's   book, and got hold of a new name; and

again mankind hurrahed for the wonderful   Ansaireh, but incontinently turned up

its nose at the supposed copyist. In proof   of the truth of these statements,

and of how I had to struggle, the world is   challenged to find a line in my

thought in the whole 4000 books on   Rosicrucianism; among the brethren of that

fraternity&#151;and I know many such   in various lands, and was, til I resigned

the office, grand Master of the only   Temple of the Order on the globe; or in

the Ansairetic works, English, German,   Syriac or Arabic. ' 28 If we consider

that Randolph's Rosicrucian and Ansairetic   teachings form the basis of modern

magical tradition and that they were written   some twenty-five years before the

founding of the Golden Dawn, his death bed   confession may be seen as the key

to the origin of modern magic!  

<BR>Whatever his contacts on the inner planes were, we do know that he founded 

 a society on the physical plane in Boston in the year 1870. Its headquarters  

were in his offices on Boylston Street and its name was the Brotherhood of  

Eulis. Its members included several other doctors who wished to investigate the 

 supernatural in a scientific manner. 29 They utilized sex and consciousness  

altering drugs and for this reason kept their teachings secret.<BR>Rumors and  

gossip of nefarious doings spread, however, and Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, later

  to found the Theosophical Society, denounced PBR, accusing him of having  

betrayed the Sacred Traditions. 30 An occult war between the two followed.  

Blavatsky championed the &quot;moral&quot; spiritualist cause while Randolph  

maintained the need to scientifically investigate the mysteries of sex and  

magic.</P>

<P>Then, in 1872, disaster struck. On a tip from his enemies, his &quot;Rosicrucian

  Rooms&quot; on Boylston Street were searched by the Boston Police and he was  

arrested for distributing &quot;free love&quot; literature. During a brief stay 

 in the Boston jail, he was persuaded to assign many of his copyrights to some  

ne'er do well opportunists. At his subsequent trial, he would be found not  

guilty of the charges, but his troubles were just beginning. 31</P>

<P>The Great Boston Fire devastated the city, completely destroying Randolph's 

 offices. 32 His laboratory was destroyed, the plates of his books were  

destroyed, nothing was left. He was denounced as a libertine by the  

spiritualists and his friends began to turn their backs on him. One acquaintance

  invited him to stay with him after the Boston fire, only to extort money from 

 him. 33 In another instance, a man and a woman known to him drugged his beer  

with morphine and robbed him, forcing him to sign false papers at gunpoint. 34  

The details of these tragedies remain sketchy, but there can be little doubt  

that his world was crumbling around him.<BR>Penniless and outcast, Randolph  

finally found sanctuary in Toledo, Ohio. He was a broken man. In May, 1873, he  

suffered a railroad injury 35 and began to view death as imminent. He had lived 

 at the pinnacle of success and now existed in the depth of despair.<BR>However,

  one bright spot was still to touch his life. He was to meet and fall in love  

with a young girl. She may well have been active in women's rights for by  

September, Randolph writes, &quot;I attended a convention of Ultra Radicals in  

Chicago, led by a noted agitatress . . .&quot; 36 PBR had always been a  

supporter of women's rights, maintaining that if there was a society for the  

prevention of cruelty to animals, there should be an organization to protect the

  rights of battered wives.<BR>Randolph and his love were married in Toledo and

  in 1874 they welcomed a son, Osiris Budh, into the world. Randolph continued

to   publish books from Toledo and to promote the Brotherhood of Eulis, but he

could   never regain the grandeur of his life in Paris and Boston.<BR>Finally,

on July   29, 1875, he shot himself through the head with his revolver. 37 His

followers   claimed that the curses and black magic of H.P. Blavatsky had

finally taken   their toll. It is interesting to note that Blavatsky founded the

Theosophical   Society in the same year.</P>

<P>There was a later book published in 1878. &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; was  

channeled from beyond the grave by two ladies from Toledo, F.H. MacDougall and  

Luna Hutchinson, but it lacked the vitality of many of his other works. 33</P>

<P>His wife and son lived on in Toledo. In fact, Osiris Budh Randolph graduated

  from Toledo Medical School in 1898 and established offices at 625 Adams

Street.   He and his family continued to live with his mother at 23 Melrose

Avenue. Many   years later, R. Swinburne Clymer would visit them to learn about

Randolph's   work. 39 It seems likely that, in an effort to &quot;whitewash&quot;

his memory,   they concealed all teachings relating to sex or drugs, emphasizing

only his &quot;moral&quot;   teachings.<BR>Clymer reprinted many of Randolph's

books from his headquarters   at &quot;Beverly Hall&quot; in Quakertown,

Pennsylvania. He also published a   book, The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America

40 which ironically attacks a German   group known as the O.T.O. for practicing

sex magic and praises PBR for his pure   teachings. Karl Kellner, the founder of

O.T.O., seems to have derived many of   the O.T.O. teachings directly from

Randolph's instructions for the Brotherhood   of Eulis.</P>

<P>Randolph's magical teachings have influenced a great many practitioners of  

the magical art, but usually in an occult, invisible manner.</P>

<P><B>The writings of Franz Bardon have become quite popular. Bardon was a  

close friend of Wilhelm (Rah Omir) Quintscher, with whom, in fact, he was  

imprisoned by the Nazis. 41 Quintscher had been a member of an offshoot of the  

O.T.O. known as the Fratenitas Saturni, lead by Eugen Grosche. Quintscher had  

reached the eighth degree grade of Gradus Mercurii but quarreled with Grosche  

and resigned. It is interesting to note that the second, third, and fourth  

degrees use the word &quot;Scholar&quot; in their title. 42 Readers of Bardon's 

 work will be familiar with the frequent use of that term by him. Any perusal of

  PBR's Sexual Magic and Bardon's Initiation into Hermetics will reveal a great 

 many similarities.</B></P>

<P>It is possible to follow the trail of Randolph's teachings to a great many  

modern writings on magic. The student of the Golden Dawn will recognize the  

original of the &quot;flashing colors&quot; exercise in the Volantia chapter of 

 Sexual Magic. 43<BR>Those who seek the original source of these things must  

look to PBR's magnum opus, Sexual Magic. It is said that during his lifetime he 

 printed only sixty copies and entrusted them only to his most select students. 

 Herein is the wisdom which has remained hidden for over one hundred years. Is  

the time ripe for its unveiling? Let us look for the answer in Pascal's own  

words:</P>

<P><I>&quot;We grow daily beyond our yesterday's and are ever reaching forth  

for the morrow. The world has had a long night, as it has had bright days; and  

now another morn is breaking, and we stand in the Door of the Dawn.&quot; </I>44</P>

<H4>p. 10 : The FLUID's and the Polarization of the Sexes.</H4>

<P>[Please notice that Randolph attributes the positive pole to women and the 

negative pole to men in the mental plane.]<BR>[Please notice also that Randolph

 speaks only of the &quot;positive or negative MAGNETIC pole (fluid)&quot; but 

never of the electric fluid.]</P>

<P>In effect, the entire universe, all living beings, without the least 

exception, are ruled by the principle of two contrary forces, exercising, one or

 the other, a power of inescapable attraction. One calls the forces positive and

 negative, and one rediscovers them in good and bad, emission and reception,

life  and death, idea and action, man and woman (positive and negative magnetic

poles)  in the material plane and, conversely, the woman (active pole) and man

(negative  pole) in the mental plane. In the science of the mysteries that we

teach, just  as in nature, the female attracts the male, so we can attract to

ourselves the  desired form by creating the negative in order to attract the

contrary, the  positive!</P>

<P>Therefore, while the phallus of the man is positively polarized and the 

kteis of the woman is negatively polarized, the head of the man, the organ of 

his mental manifestations is, to the contrary, negative and magnetic for rapport

 with the head of the woman which is positive and electric.</P>

<H3>Sexual Magic Operations </H3>

<H5>General Rules </H5>

<P>In the preceding pages, the reader can study rules and principles which make

 possible, with proper application and execution, the realization of formidable 

things. We now pass on to sexual operations so-called, which cannot be 

efficacious without all that has previously been explained. These operations are

 the basis of the  mysteries known under the name &quot;Mahi Kaligua, &quot; and

 derive from the Euclidian principle that we spoke of at the beginning of this 

work. One can practice this for many diverse reasons, but we limit ourselves to 

these seven principles:</P>

<OL>

<LI>The charging of &quot;Volts&quot; and other fluid condensers.</LI>

<LI>The regeneration of the Vital Force and reinforcement of the Magnetic 

Fluid.</LI>

<LI>The production of the Magnetic Fluid to effect the submission of the man to

 the woman or of the woman to the man.</LI>

<LI>The refinement of Power or of the Senses.</LI>

<LI>The determination, by Volantia, of the sex of a child to be conceived or 

the reinforcement of its mental or material capacities.</LI>

<LI>The provocation of superhuman visions, spiritual and sublime.</LI>

<LI>The realization of a project or of a special desire of the  operator, in 

any order of idea.</LI></OL>

<P>Supposing that the student has studied and understood all that we have 

revealed in the preceding chapters, we give, hereafter, the twenty principle 

rules that are necessary to learn in order to properly understand the special 

exercises of sexual magic.</P>

<OL>

<LI>Sexual union as considered with a prayer. The man who lives with his woman 

in perfect harmony, understands us easily and he, who has a good time being with

 a loving and magnetic woman in all purity of sentiment and intention, is 

reminded of another circumstance of life that is not abysmal but profound, for 

it also comes toward God and perfection, and in this radiance all of their 

conjoined forces touch the root of the opposite sex. For when the sexual act is 

perfect, the union of man and woman succeeds in all spheres of their respective 

beings, and their force increases tenfold in the higher worlds. The prayer, this

 prayer, is always exhausting. But, it is necessary that the demand, the vow,

the  object of the prayer be formulated and imagined clearly. If the man and the

 woman imagine the same object, or wish the same thing, this is better; but the 

prayer of one of the two souls can also be efficacious, for if the woman is 

entranced in the orgasm, the creative power is the same.</LI>

<LI>Don't mix precious metal with base substance: unite with a woman of 

superior morals. Never use a prostitute or an ignorant virgin for a magical 

operation, nor a minor of less than 18 years of either sex; but accomplish the 

solemn act with your spouse or your lover. It is necessary in all cases, that 

the woman chosen for the rite should have sexual knowledge of the man, be 

possessed of good health in body and mind, and she should have profound feelings

 of affection and emotion for the priest; for in this way is the orgasm of the 

two magically efficacious&#151;it also makes the moment of the female emanation 

coincide with the moment of the male ejaculation and only in this way is the 

magic effective.</LI>

<LI>The union of the man with the woman must be innocent. Lust for pleasure 

must not be the main purpose. Transcending carnal pleasure, aim at the union of 

the spirits, if you want your prayer to be exhausted in ecstasy. If you conform 

to these principles, the sexual act will become a source of spiritual and 

material force for you and a fountainhead of wisdom, happiness and peace. In 

magic, you search for that which is called the fortune of spirit.</LI>

<LI>The physical body must be cared for properly. Hygiene is always a sacred 

responsibility, but especially when you prepare yourself for the rite of sexual 

union. We tell you that certain preparation must be made 7 days and 41 days in 

advance of the operation. Cleanliness is, then, of particular importance.</LI>

<LI>Keep secret your magical intentions. Silence concentrates your forces and 

multiplies them. This is why, when you are entering into the preparation period 

for an act of magic, you should not frequent the society of mundane persons too 

often and you should talk as little as possible.</LI>

<LI> Formulate your desire in advance and don't forget that desire at the 

moment of coition, during which it is necessary to keep silence.</LI>

<LI>Before, during and after the act of love, hold a clear image of that which 

you wish. The exercises of Volantia, Posism and Decretism are a great help 

during the period of preparation.</LI>

<LI>Eat simply and prefer natural foods; don't take too much; don't drink too 

many liquids; avoid grease, alcohol, spices. Sleep in a hard bed, the head to 

the north, the pillow flat. Your bedroom should always be cold and well aired.</LI>

<LI>Take a bath of air, two times a week: Breath deeply and retain the air in 

your lungs for as long as possible. Know that every additional minute you endure

 will add 10 days to your life.</LI>

<LI> Don't look at your woman too often and look only when you are both 

excited. Sleep in separate bedrooms and do not unite more than one or two times 

a week. The man must never touch a woman who is not sensitive to his touch and 

he must never stop until she has trembled with desire at least two times. This 

is a recommendation of great importance.</LI>

<LI>Don't take the woman if you are angry or if you are ill.</LI>

<LI>Sleep well and, when you sleep, trust in yourself and the force of Divine 

Law.</LI>

<LI>Don't forget this important axiom: Love is the root of life. Of budding 

love: It grows according to circumstance, passion, temper, impulse, good or bad,

 the flame divine or human, the demons or the gods. Through your love, you unite

 with God!</LI>

<LI> The instant that the semen of the man passes into the body of the woman 

who accepts it, is the instant of greatest fecundity, the greatest power, the 

greatest emotion of the life of man. If he is, however, under the influence of 

carnal passion, of bestial instinct, the man is suicide, lost demoralized. To 

the woman, he will give disease and chaos, psychic and material. And the child 

he procreates will become an assassin, a mental cripple, a miserable being. To 

the contrary, if the union of the man with the woman is effected in the harmony 

of mutual love and, consequently, the ambient occult forces of the environment 

participate with joy in the solemn act, the man and the woman work to regenerate

 those forces and the fruit of their embrace is success. The child of love is

the  child of superior forces, and the prayer of two hearts united is an

efficacious  prayer.</LI>

<LI> If a man ardently wishes a force or power into being and guards this wish 

from the instant that he penetrates into the woman until the instant that he 

withdraws from her, his wish is necessarily fulfilled. Hell reigns in the 

household of the man who has the bad habit of retiring before ejaculation 

because he no longer wishes to procreate. As a cause of this, he installs hell 

in the root of two beings, because they prostitute love, ignoring the great 

good, the primordial reason of life. The lost semen and unconverted spirit 

degenerates.</LI>

<LI>All the forces and powers emanate from the feminine aspect of God, which 

also comes from every impulse. To draw forth the Divine Force in complete love, 

in real sympathy, in willing emotion, then you give beauty. The mind is sterile 

and its force is rapidly exhausted; This is why we, the Euclidians, search for 

spiritual triumph not in the intellect, which tires and does not succeed, but in

 the will to love, which is unceasingly fertile. When one of us who has the gift

 of a healer undertakes a healing, it is necessary to call not upon the 

intellect, but on love. His countenance must be pleasing and good, his hands are

 caressing, his heart wishes and speaks, and a good result is infallibly 

obtained. For love, sympathy and virtue form a ladder which leads to innumerable

 forces, the power and the wisdom of the heavens.</LI></OL>

<H4>p. 59 :  FLUID CONDENSERS</H4>

<P>Magic is a science. It is the only science which occupies itself, 

theoretically and practically, with the highest forces of nature, which are 

occult. It declares and proves that the universe, in its totality as in each of 

its smallest parts, is subject to certain fluid influences and that science can 

prove this, the day that it will, to be the basis of all psychic and physical 

phenomenon.<BR>To operate with these forces, according to the laws which 

regulate them, it is necessary, first of all, to concentrate them in a point or 

on a given surface. One can, then, guide and channel them at will.<BR>These 

operations, which are very important and which offer the possibility of many 

varied realizations, can be made in four different fashions:</P>

<OL>

<LI> <B>The operator can make use of his own energy proper. </B></LI>

<LI><B>He can act with the outer forces by means of induction and of the 

correspondences.</B></LI>

<LI><B>He can bind the outer force to an individual object which has been 

chosen for this.</B></LI>

<LI><B>He can bind these forces to an object  that, in general, is of the 

material of his choice. 

</B></LI></OL>

<P>This last procedure has been known for thousands of years as talismanic 

magic. It is also used for that which is called &quot;<B>The Charging of Volts</B>,&quot;

 which we have spoken of in a preceding chapter.<BR>Meanwhile, in verifying the

 technique of these preparations, we have found that in practice, a shortage of 

laboratory knowledge often induces one to use insufficiently pure materials for 

the <B>condensation of the fluids</B>. Also, quite often, only some of the 

necessary materials are chosen, thereby giving the formula only partially and 

diminishing the efficacy of the talismans and &quot;Volts.&quot;<BR>To avoid 

this error and to obtain, henceforth, perfect results, we have studied and 

completed three types of  irreproachable fluid condensers&#151;two <B>liquid</B>

 and one <B>solid</B> &#151;which all may use satisfactorily.</P>

<OL>

<LI>The first type of condenser is employed by us in the form of a coat of 

paint, which we apply gradually on objects to which we wish to attach talismanic

 virtues.</LI>

<LI>The second we conserve in a special bottle for the preparation of very 

effective liquid drugs.</LI>

<LI>The third type, the solid condenser, is employed in our laboratories for 

the fabrication of &quot;Volts.&quot; Here is the table of proportions to use in

 the preparation of our drugs:

<P>For these drugs to act as one wishes, it is necessary to conform, in their 

preparation, to the following recommendations:</P>

<OL>

<LI>The extracts of the plants should be prepared by maceration in pure 

alcohol, where they must be left for forty days.<BR>The vase used in this 

operation should not be exposed to the sun or, in general, to daylight.<BR>The 

temperature of the room where the vase with the alcohol used for the maceration 

of the extracts is kept must be constantly maintained at 90 degrees Fahrenheit.<BR>For

 each 100 grams of herb, it is necessary to use 120 grams of alcohol.</LI>

<LI>The pressed extracts are prepared by compilation.</LI>

<LI> To obtain the coal of the plants, enclose these hermetic remains in a bowl

 of blown glass and then plunge it into a fire of wood or coal.</LI>

<LI>Beeswax, which we recommend for certain mixtures, must be boiled three 

times in pure water, in advance.</LI>

<LI>The oil Kopal, a lacquered gum, must be washed in cold running water before

 using.</LI>

<LI>Before proceeding with the mixture of the characteristic compositions, one 

should hermetically seal a sufficient volume of the fluid condenser in a vase or

 bottle. This vase, or bottle, containing the condenser, must remain in cold 

running water for ten days.</LI>

<LI>When drying the plants that are used in the magical preparations, one 

carefully sees to it that they do not fall under the influence of the light of 

day. Be sure to maintain the temperature of the laboratory at 90 degrees 

Fahrenheit or more.</LI>

<LI> To isolate the fluid condensers from the light of day, one surrounds the 

vase, or bottle, which contains them, with many layers of a cloth of natural 

silk, which has been carefully washed in running water before using it. The 

operation of the mixing of the condensers must be made in artificial light.</LI></OL>

<H4>p. 64 :  &quot;VOLTS&quot; and Statuettes</H4>

<P>All experimental magic is based on the laws of correspondences, of 

sympathies and of polarizations. While the laws of polarizations determine the 

force of attraction between the two contrary poles ( + and - ), the laws of 

correspondences and of sympathies exist for all the etheric forces, spread out 

through space and on the earth; their elements, or materials, correspond in the 

same manner as their sound, their color, their rhythm, and their perfume, 

sympathetically.</P>

<P>The profound study of these diverse correspondences allow us to successfully

 operate with the aid of solid fluid condensers (type 3), which we call &quot;Volts.&quot;<BR>These

 condensers are figurines, prepared in a special fashion (see more below). They 

are charged, according to the method that we indicate here, with the psychic 

force of an individual in order to cure an illness, to correct or improve a 

person's nature, or even to cast a spell, beneficial or malefic, with the aid of

 the laws of Correspondences and sympathies.<BR>The preparation of a &quot;Volt&quot;

 requires the following operations:</P>

<OL>

<LI>The definition and fabrication of the perfume and the individual color of 

the subject.</LI>

<LI>The introduction into the solid condenser:<BR>a.) of the liquid condenser 

#2 (see more above) in the proportion of 20: 1.<BR>b.) of the individual 

perfume in the proportion of 1:10.</LI>

<LI>The material is, therefore, molded into a statuette that closely resembles 

either the entire body or the part of the body of the subject which one wishes 

to influence.</LI>

<LI>Fluid condenser #1 (see more above) is mixed with a powdered color in order

 to obtain the desired individual color.</LI>

<LI>. Then paint the statue with the color thus obtained. It may be necessary 

to paint two or, even, three coats.</LI>

<LI>When the paint is completely dry, wash the statuette in very clean running 

water.</LI>

<LI>The vase into which the statuette will be placed for its isolation must be 

prepared in the following fashion: Choose thick and pure glass for it and 

upholster it, inside and outside, with four layers of natural silk cloth, which 

has been well washed before. Before the layers of silk are applied, the exterior

 surface of the vase must additionally receive a light coat of an amalgam of

gold  and mercury. One tracts the lid of the vase in the same manner. 

<BR>When the statuette is placed in the vase, one seals the lid hermetically 

and puts the vase with the statuette in a box of hardwood.</LI>

<LI>To charge the &quot;Volt&quot; with the energy of the subject for whom it 

is destined, it suffices that the latter should keep the &quot;Volt&quot; in 

their bedroom or, better still, in their pocket for ten days.<BR>After that, 

the subject in question must, herself, put the statue back into the vase and the

 vase into the box; and it is essential that no other person should assist in 

this operation and that no person should touch the statuette except the subject.<BR>One

 can easily conceive that any strangers who, through curiosity, would meddle 

about the operation, might charge the &quot;Volt &quot; with a contrary 

influence, which could be very dangerous. This is why you should never forget 

the rule of secrecy if you want your &quot;Volt&quot; to be efficacious and if 

you don't want to render all the zeal brought to your fabrication in vain.</LI>

<H4>p. 67 :  Neutralizing a &quot;VOLT&quot;</H4>

<P>[Bardon gives a similar method in IIH when he describes the destruction of 

an Elementar.]</P>

<P>See to it that it is touched only by yourself and the person for whom it is 

intended.</P>

<P>Don't forget that if a &quot;Volt&quot; breaks, the person to whom it is 

henceforth bound by an inescapable occult link, will die at the same instant. 

You have, therefore, in your hands, the life and death of the person, who 

confides themselves to you. You take on a solemn obligation and you must comport

 yourself with dignity.</P>

<P>One recalls historic cases during the middle ages when this method was used 

to wipe out many living persons, provoking the wrath of much power on earth. In 

more recent times, the same method has been employed to accomplish 

assassinations which remain inexplicable to justice. One finds, in certain 

cases, little wounds or punctures on the bodies of the dead that are not enough 

to justify death and one does not dream of finding an inhuman Mage, who amuses 

himself by perforating, with a needle or the point of a sharp knife, the flesh, 

apparently inert, of a statue whose occult link can turn life into death.</P>

<P>10. To neutralize the &quot;Volt&quot; and to annul its link with the 

subject, it is necessary to plunge it into water heated to 122 degrees 

Fahrenheit. For complete neutralization, the statuette must stay in the hot bath

 for three days. The temperature in the room must be stabilized at 60 degrees 

Fahrenheit.</P>

<P>11. Sometimes&#151;although very rarely&#151;the three days prescribed are 

not sufficient to eliminate all the effects of the &quot;Volt&quot; on the 

subject. In this case, the bath of the statue must be repeated one or two more 

times.</P>

<H4>p 79: Individual Fluid Condensers</H4>

<P>[Please notice Randolph's very interesting and original opinion about a 

fully balanced person.] 

</P>

<P>To prepare an individual fluid condenser, one establishes, first of all, the

 respective values of the forces and the planetary weaknesses. This, then, will 

reveal the scheme of the natal horoscope of the person with whom one is 

occupied.</P>

<P>Generally, one establishes an evident predominance of one of the planets 

over all the others, by a very strong numerical indication. Other forces are 

found to the contrary, to be in weakness and, often, have negative values. It is

 useful for the operator to fill in these gaps by means of the fluid condenser; 

by attracting to the subject the planetary influences which he lacks, 

accentuating and augmenting his insufficient faculties. 

</P>

<P>The horoscope of an perfectly balanced individual would give the same 

numerical indication for all the planetary influences in the natal theme. 

Expressed in colors, with the horoscope presented on a disk and divided into 

seven equal parts, all the planetary shades would be united.<BR>But an 

individual thus influenced has no preponderant capacity and his life elapses in 

a dreadful monotony. He brings nothing original, nothing of interest.<BR>This 

monster of equilibrium has no possibility of concentrating on a problem of any 

kind for very long that is not strictly necessary for his physical existence. He

 can never, then, develop in himself a mental current susceptible to training

for  superior horizons. This is a mediocre, a man of small emotions and dead 

aspirations, without passions or special characteristics. He does not awake fear

 or love in another person and he give nothing remarkable to humanity.</P>

<P>We must be careful not to create an equilibrium thus monstrous in a person 

who confides themselves to us. Therefore, allow the force that rules to dominate

 and only intervene when the accentuation of a very weak faculty can be useful, 

without harming the originality of nature. We do well to recall that the 

horoscopes of geniuses are, often, catastarous.</P>

<P>Moreover, the more skillful operator never essentially modifies the specific

 character of this subject, for that which he can attract by means of a fluid 

condenser is never equivalent to a direct planetary influence in the natal 

theme.</P>

<P>This which we can do is to correct, to add to, to improve, so that it will 

be better afterwards. A weak memory can be fortified, shaky health improved, 

exaggerated bad luck softened.</P>

<P>But, quite often, to obtain the desired result, it is necessary to have 

recourse to the simultaneous exercise of Volantia, of suggestion and also of 

Posism, so that the action of the jewel may be truly efficacious. The 

preparation of planetary charts has been sufficiently described in the preceding

 chapters. The particulars concerning individual charges are as follows:</P>

<OL>

<LI>To fabricate the reservoir, one chooses the metal corresponding to the 

planetary force that rules the natal horoscope.<BR>The precious stones and the 

contents of the reservoir must be in precise harmony with the numerical 

indications of the different secondary planets that figure in the horoscope.</LI>

<LI>	One adds the fluid condenser to the composition, which fills the reservoir

 in the proportions of 10:1.</LI>

<LI>One proceeds with charging the condenser when the ruling planet is in good 

aspect, so that one can harness the force.</LI></OL>

<P>It goes without saying that the individual planetary charges can only be 

useful to the person when the horoscope has been consulted in the course of the 

different operations of fabrication. However, the owner of the magical jewel can

 utilize it, in certain cases, for influencing a person of the opposite sex, 

according to his desire.</P>

<H4>p 85: MAGIC MIRRORS</H4>

<H5>Theory </H5>

<P>Many Occultists of our time no longer know the possibility of seeing, in the

 magic mirror, persons and scenes evoked by the mage. They have forgotten this 

antique belief because their talents and insufficient science cannot permit them

 to establish, by this tempting experience, the confirmation of this fact, 

nevertheless real. The celebrated Dr. Dee of London, and many others before him,

 used, for this sort of vision, a concave mirror of blackened glass, and also 

other things, to attract the image or idea form the upper spheres, that they 

could not capture otherwise&#151;the material age can only admit that a simple 

physical coefficient, that of the concave oval mirror, the crystal, or a drop of

 ink, may attempt to draw from the spirit that which the latter jealously guards

 in its impenetrable profundity. It is a material proof within the reach of all.

 We will strive to give it here.</P>

<P>We do not doubt that the Christian conception of the immortality of the soul

 conforms with truth. A thousand things prove it, and we know it as we know that

 the power which created the world is much stronger than the waves of the sea.</P>

<P>Certainly, there are true mediums in the world, who know how to place 

themselves in rapport with departed souls. But for each one of them, there are 

innumerable men without hearts, practical jokers who dream only of filling their

 pockets with the stolen gold of credulous, ignorant persons. They have effaced 

occultists before a crowd of fools.</P>

<H5>Technique</H5>

<P>If you want to use a magic mirror, don't forget the following roles:</P>

<OL>

<LI>The mirror must only be touched by its owner, in order to avoid the mixture

 of strange magnetism, which can annul that which the mirror was charged for. 

Other persons may look at it, but they must not touch the frame or the surface 

of the mirror.</LI>

<LI>If the surface of the mirror is tarnished, one should remove the dirt with 

soap. Next, one washes it with alcohol and, when the mirror is dry, one polishes

 it again with some oxygen fluorine, wiping it with a rag of smooth silk or a 

deerskin.</LI>

<LI>Every day, for five minutes, one magnetizes the mirror with the right hand.</LI>

<LI>Following that, one refines the action of the surface of the mirror by 

means of magnetic passes made with the left hand.</LI>

<LI>The more often and the longer that one uses a magnetic mirror, the better 

it is, for the action of the mirror augments its use.</LI>

<LI>To sleep with the aid of the magnetic mirror, it is necessary to fix the 

attention in the center, calmly and without the least preoccupation of the 

spirit. Visions will appear, then, while dreaming.</LI>

<LI>It is necessary that the brilliant surface of the mirror should not be 

struck by the rays of the sun, which paralyze its magical action&#151;when you 

use the mirror, present its back to the window.</LI>

<LI> The magic mirror must be as clear as a book.</LI>

<LI>If several persons wish to look at the same time, hang the mirror on the 

wall&#151;and let no person touch it.</LI>

<LI>The best position for vision in the magic mirror is one where no one's 

reflection is witnessed. You can find this position by inclining the mirror in 

all ways, until the surface shows a lone sheet of deep water, smooth and limpid.

 When the magnetism, coming from your eyes, has been accumulated above the

mirror  (a few millimeters above its surface), the limpid water will be replaced

by the  desired vision.</LI>

<LI>One sees, at first, clouds of various colors. These clouds appear to form 

in the material of the mirror, but it is only an optical illusion. In reality, 

it is greatly concentrated magnetism.</LI>

<LI>Dark, Brunette persons, with black eyes and magnetic temperaments, can 

charge the mirror more rapidly, but not as powerfully as blond persons of an 

electric temperament. In general, one can tell which men will not easily see and

 which women, when the see, will distinguish much and be troubled little.</LI>

<LI>In this fashion, it has been proven that young boys and girls who have not 

attained the age of puberty, see more palpably and clearly because their 

magnetism is pure and non-sexual. Purity is, as one knows, a coefficient for all

 action, magnetic and occult.</LI>

<LI>White clouds, seen in the magic mirror, are of a good foreboding. The 

response that they give to a question has a positive value.</LI>

<LI>Black clouds are a sign of alarm. Their sense is negation.</LI>

<LI>Violet, Green and Blue clouds are good.</LI>

<LI>Red-Carmine, Bright Orange, and Yellow clouds announce bad influences.</LI>

<LI>If you operate with the magic mirror in order to influence an absent 

person, evoke their image with the force of your will. When it is before you in 

the mirror, fix it firmly and concentrate all your imagination on it. Your 

influence will strike it infallibly, to import only at the point of the earth 

where it is found. But, don't forget, that you must submit to the backlash that 

you have incurred: the evil you must pay in evil, the good you must pay in good.</LI>

<LI>Have a patience when you consult the magic mirror. Certain persons see 

easily, others must wait longer.</LI>

<LI>The surface of the mirror must be submitted to no chemical or optical 

influence, and one should carefully preserve it from the light of the sun, for 

it is as sensitive as a photographic plate. The Lunar light is, to the contrary,

 beneficial. Cold and warm extremes are harmful for extreme temperatures annul 

the force.</LI>

<LI>All vision, which appears in the magic mirror to the left of the observer, 

is the image of a concrete truth.</LI>

<LI>That which manifests to the right is symbolic. It must be interpreted 

according to the traditional significance of the symbols.</LI>

<LI>The clouds or shadows, which move upwards in magical visions, are the 

affirmative responses to the questions posed.</LI>

<LI>The clouds, or shadows, that descend, are negative responses.</LI>

<LI>The shadows, that move to the left or right, signal the presence of an 

occult intelligence.</LI>

<LI>These clouds, that move towards the right or left, signify that a seance 

should be raised.</LI>

<LI>If, after much patience, the willed result has still not been effected, it 

is permissible to use the stimulant powder, which we will speak of later in a 

special chapter. But this powder is dangerous for many men; it must be used with

 prudence and as infrequently as possible. When the stimulant powder has made

its  effect, it is necessary to continue the work without it.

<P>In figure 15, we give an exact diagram for the construction of the magic 

mirrors which are called &quot;special&quot;. One may make many variations of 

detail with these, according to the goal for which the mirror is destined. We

<H4>p 116: LIVING PICTURES</H4>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="randol6.jpg" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/randol6.jpg"></P>

<P>Under certain conditions, by scrupulously accomplishing the magical work 

that will be explained in this chapter, one can animate, that is to say render 

truly alive, certain portraits and statues, in order to influence one or many 

senses of a chosen man or woman. The influence, that one thus projects, can be 

mental or physical, indifferently.</P>

<P>The doctrine of Living Magical Pictures is not new. In the middle ages, 

certain painters knew it very well and applied it to their art; but, also, one 

finds cases where the human magnetic fluid is concentrated in an old portrait, 

forgotten in the corner of a salon of some feudal chateau through the monotonous

 years, until it is discovered to reveal scenes of violent passions. One also 

speaks of certain sacred paintings, made on the walls of Christian temples. They

 can become suddenly animated and exhibit real wonders.</P>

<P>Obviously, the will of the wise man initiated in the mysteries of the great 

magical art can better and more surely create this than a fortuitous discovery. 

The mages and sorcerers of the preceding centuries knew it and they studied this

 problem thoroughly.<BR>They teach, in their rediscovered writings, that an oil

 paint, made with the oil of the poppy, is an excellent fluid condenser and a 

gold guilded frame is a perfect insulator.</P>

<P>Fixed on the wall of a church, where persons kneeling in prayer often see 

it, or hung on the silk drapes of a salon, where it is exalted in dreams and 

violent passions, and artistic work may become, little by little, the true 

center of life. The oil holds the human fluids and the guilded frame prevents 

leakage of them.<BR>We must not forget that some charlatans and other men of 

bad faith have shamefully profited from this averred truth to gain money by 

deceiving credulous clients; but this does not negate that which is nevertheless

 true.<BR>We possess many authentic grimoires in our lodge which tract of this 

subject. When we read these ancient writings, it seems to us that sometimes the 

green eye of the true magic of the Evil One flashes its terrible gaze at us.</P>

<P>For example, we find, in certain receipts, that a mixture of colors, to 

which has been added the blood of a fetus, which has been pulled out of the 

belly of its mother by the operation of the cross, is of a sublime efficacy. Of 

other receipts we see, that if one mixes into the paint some drops of the blood 

of a pure virgin, who is offered, after this, to the pleasure of a succubus, one

 may give formidable power to a living picture.</P>

<P>There are some drugs, recommended to painters, which contain a human 

magnetic charge, to be used during solitary excitation. Their effect is 

particularly malefic. Living pictures have been used through the dark ages to 

perpetrate mysterious assassinations: An enemy, masked by the gentleness of the 

gift offered, sends out death in a succubique picture, and the person receiving 

the gift, who hangs the portrait in his room, will die soon after.<BR>The Holy 

Inquisition enforced an end to these terrifying abuses by burning the 

manuscripts of the mages and persecuting the sorcerers. The entire science of 

magic could have disappeared in this ferocious reaction of Catholicism but, 

fortunately for us and for the future of humanity, they found some philosophies 

which concealed the secret and were thus protected from the vengeful hands. 

These were works that cultivated the magical art for pure motives of initiated 

wisdom.<BR>It is thus that one of our brothers, living in Spain in the first 

half of the 18th century, was able to recover manuscripts containing some 

receipts and counsels of great importance. This brother devoted ten years of his

 life to these studies and researches.</P>

<P>[And so on ... Please refer to the book. ]</P>

<H4>p 125: THE LIVING STATUES</H4>

<P>These principle teachings also permit the preparation of statues and other 

living sculptures. One makes them, most often, by sculpting in dark brown earth.

 When they are ready, one bronzes them. Next, one bathes them in the individual 

perfume mixed with the fluid condenser.</P>

<P>This bath, which is a maceration, must last for twenty days. After removing 

it from the bath, the sculpture must dry for six days in a normal temperature.<BR>When

 it is completely dry, one gives it a coat of paint with the colors prepared as 

for the living pictures. The hollowed out space of the statues must be filled 

with a living liquid, that one knows of from the receipt and manner of 

preparation. The opening through which one introduces this liquid is soldered by

 means of an amalgam of gold.<BR>Plaster, wood and porcelain are equally 

recommended materials for this sort of statues. One can also use the materials 

indicated for the preparation of &quot;'Volts&quot; with success.<BR>The 

prepared statue should be placed on an insulated stand, at a distance of ten 

centimeters from the reflecting surface. One can find all other details 

necessary for this preparation in Table A.<BR>The magic of living Sculptures 

was often practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece and India, where every day one saw 

certain idols, haloed in gold with an incomprehensible destiny.<BR></P>
