  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ordinary&quot; 
      people (i.e. those not inclined versus the occult), when confronted with 
      Bardons works in most cases will tell you that &quot;it's all an invention&quot;, 
      silly and not reliable. Putting aside, that a small number of &quot;altered 
      states of consciousness&quot; are accepted by science today like hypnosis, 
      lucid dreaming, catalepsy and a few others, most of Bardons descriptions 
      would be rejected by most of today's scientists.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though, 
      there exists one further proof, that Bardons system is not only &quot;thought 
      out&quot;, a product of fantasy, but may indeed be a large compilation of 
      methods to acquire &quot;exotic abilities&quot; which are not yet well understood 
      by modern science.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      the following I will describe the findings of a number of scientists, which 
      confirm that an advanced technique described by Bardon in his first book 
      is indeed a reliable and trustworthy one.</font></p>

    <h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The creation of a &quot;mentally 
      vacant space&quot;.</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Franz 
      Bardon describes in his basic course, <b>Initiation into Hermetics</b>, 
      in step V, &quot;Magical schooling of the body&quot;, a method that &quot;makes 
      conscious passive communications with the invisible possible&quot; (page 
      148 f, Merkur Edition). For that purpose one must, to get ready, do preparatory 
      &quot;levitation&quot;-exercises. To that end one &quot;loads&quot; his 
      hand with &quot;vital power&quot; and then with the &quot;element of air&quot;. 
      When the student is able to do this he proceeds to the next step where he 
      must learn to create a &quot;mentally vacant space&quot; in his hand and 
      arm. That means that he must extract his &quot;mental hand&quot; which is 
      part of his &quot;mental body&quot; on the &quot;mental plane&quot; from 
      his physical counterpart and he must place this &quot;mental&quot; hand 
      and arm beside the physical hand or he lets it glide through the table to 
      rest on his knee. Bardon continues: &quot;You must consider the imagined 
      spirit hand<b></b> to be your real hand. As a result of this, a mentally 
      vacant space develops within the physical hand which has the form of the 
      external hand.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many 
      scientists and most people would regard such descriptions as really beyond 
      belief and far-fetched and can not understand how some people can be so 
      naive to consider such gibberish as reliable possibilities. But even a student 
      of Bardons works who was able to master some of Bardons techniques might 
      have possibly a hard time when he thinks about the task that he himself 
      must be able to do exactly as Bardon claims.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore 
      it may be very surprising for most readers of this article, that indeed 
      this very method can be proven immediately by everyone without the need 
      of any &quot;magical&quot; training. But if you are really able to contact 
      &quot;spirits&quot; or &quot;deceased souls&quot; with this method, you 
      must find out for yourself. Bardons methods are, or at least, this method 
      described by Bardon is, not merely a thought out invention but is based 
      on true possibilities.</font></p>

    <h4 align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phantom 
      limbs, today's state of research.</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      order that the reader can get a clear picture of how the following method 
      works we must talk at first a bit about phantom limbs: therefore I will 
      report here briefly a summary of today's state of research in phantom limbs.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      a person loses one of his limbs due to amputation, in an accident, etc., 
      then very often he will feel sharp pains in those regions, where the limb 
      has been removed. This is a strange fact: how can it be, that someone feels 
      pain in a part of the body where actually nothing material is present?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      phenomenon was first described in <b>1866</b> by S. Weir Mitchel, the foremost 
      American neurologist of his time, in his first account of phantom limbs. 
      He reports the case of a man who loses at first one of his arms and then 
      both his legs too, unbeknownst to him, to amputation in the hospital during 
      the Civil War.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I 
      was suddenly aware of a sharp cramp in my left leg. I tried to get at it 
      with my single arm, but finding myself too weak, hailed an attendant. &laquo;Just 
      rub my left calf, if you please.&raquo; &laquo;Calf? You ain't got none, 
      pardner. It's took off.&raquo;&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ronald 
      Melzack points out in his article &quot;Phantom limbs&quot; (Scientific 
      American, April 1992), that: &quot;In fact, the phenomenon of phantom limbs 
      is common. So is the occurrence of terrible pain in these invisible appendages.&quot; 
      And he continues: &quot;The most extraordinary feature of phantoms is their 
      reality to the amputee. Their vivid sensory qualities and precise location 
      in space especially at first make the limbs feel so lifelike that a patient 
      may try to step off a bed onto a phantom foot or lift a cup with a phantom 
      hand. The phantom, in fact, may seem more substantial than an actual limb 
      ...&quot;. And: &quot;The reality of the phantom is also enhanced by wearing 
      an artificial arm or leg; the phantom usually fills the prothesis as a hand 
      fits a glove.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well 
      known is the old assumption, that the sensations of phantom limbs are generated 
      by the remaining nerves in the stump that continue to generate impulses 
      which then are interpreted by the brain as coming from the associated parts 
      in the body. The brain assumes that an input from a (obviously removed) 
      part of the body has been received and generates the false impression of 
      the phantom limb. This explanation is now outdated due to research of the 
      last decades. In order to cure the intolerable pain the relevant nerves 
      have been cut within the spinal cord and even the areas of the thalamus 
      and cortex which receive sensory information from these areas have been 
      removed to no avail. None of these measures removes the phantom limb.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Any 
      explanation must account for the rich variety of sensations a person can 
      feel, the intense reality of the phantom ... &quot; Melzack explains, &quot;The 
      sense of reality is also strengthened by the wide range of sensations a 
      phantom limb can have. Pressure, warmth, cold ...&quot; &quot;A phantom 
      can feel wet (as when an artificial foot is seen stepping into a puddle).&quot; 
      And he continues: &quot;A final striking feature of phantoms which reinforces 
      the reality still further, is that they are experienced as a part of oneself. 
      That is, patients perceive them as integral part of the body. A phantom 
      foot is described not only as real but as unquestionably belonging to that 
      person.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melzack 
      proposes such a model, which accounts for the mentioned features of phantom 
      limbs and he says about his model: &quot;..., but it must, of course, be 
      tested more fully before its value can be assessed completely.&quot; Basically 
      he postulates in his model, that the brain contains a neuromatrix = a network 
      of neurons, that model artificially the entire body in accordance with the 
      incoming sensory data. He calls this neuromatrix, this pattern &quot;the 
      <b>neurosignature</b>&quot;. Melzack describes different layers or systems 
      which this neurosignature must contain and the relevant parts of the CNS 
      (central nervous system) which account for it. Please read the original 
      paper for further details. He states also, that when some areas of the brain 
      that are important for this neurosignature, are damaged then it happens 
      that patients may &quot;push one of their own legs out of a hospital bed, 
      because they were convinced it belonged to a stranger.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      important point is, in my opinion, Melzacks assumption that this body scheme 
      represented by the neuromatrix is working on its own but is constantly &quot;updated&quot; 
      by the sensory inputs which come from the diverse parts of our body. Therefore, 
      if we cut the input from the sensory apparatus down in some way then this 
      neural network which processes these signals will take over and will create 
      the impression of a separate body besides the &quot;real, material&quot; 
      body. Therefore we can speak about two systems:</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. 
      Our body and the sensory systems which connect us to the &quot;real (=outside) 
      world&quot;, and<br>
      2. The artificial body scheme generated in the brain by the neuromatrix 
      = neurosignature.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      an analogy to the computer sciences we may say that this body scheme, this 
      network of neurons, is like a software program which &quot;runs&quot; independently 
      from the hardware peripherals. An image can be generated by the peripherals 
      like e.g. a scanner, a digital camera, it can be loaded from the internet, 
      etc. and then processed by a program like Adobes Photoshop, but on the other 
      hand you need no signal from the periphery, you can use your paint program 
      to create a complete new picture on its own.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      long as we live an &quot;ordinary&quot; life and nothing special happens, 
      the difference between these two working systems gets by unnoticed. Only 
      if the first system gets separated from the second one by any means, the 
      autonomous working of the second one becomes apparent.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      is for example the case, as we have seen above, when the nerve fiber connection 
      between the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS, brain) is disconnected. 
      But this is only one possibility: the nerves can be ruptured by a trauma 
      (e.g. a tennis incident with a muscle/nerve rupture), or they can be damaged 
      by a virus as it happens with polio, or they can get paralyzed by a local 
      anesthesia. Of course the ultimate possibility is the case when the nerves 
      of a certain region of the body have never existed.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      scientists dispute how this neuromatrix forms. Melzack writes: &quot;I depart 
      from Hebb, however, in that I visualize the neuromatrix as an assembly whose 
      connections are primarily determined not by experience but by the genes.&quot; 
      and &quot;I think the matrix is largely prewired, for the simple reason 
      that my colleagues and I have encountered many people who were born without 
      an arm or a leg and yet experience a vivid phantom. For example, an intelligent 
      and serious eight-year-old boy, who was born with paralyzed legs and a right 
      arm that ends at the elbow, tells us that when he fits his elbow into a 
      small cup so as to manipulate a lever that allows him to move his wheelchair, 
      phantom fingers, &quot;like everyone else's fingers&quot;, emerge from his 
      elbow and grasp the edges of the cup.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surgeons 
      who operate people that are treated only with local anesthesia reported 
      repeatedly the frequent complaint of patients, that something strange was 
      going on with their hand or arm. The surgeon, after the administration of 
      the local anesthesia operates the hand or arm which is concealed behind 
      a small screen to protect the patient from disturbing pictures of blood, 
      sores and the surgeons instruments. After a wile some patients complain 
      or express their concern that even they can feel no pain it seems that their 
      arm/hand has moved and how it might be possible to operate in such a condition 
      when the arm has assumed such a strange position in middle air. The surgeon 
      must then calm down the patient stating that all goes well, that the hand 
      has not moved and that it's all only a subjective &quot;impression&quot; 
      of the patient.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      reality the virtual arm of the body scheme begins to work on its own and 
      the patient has the impression of strange movements of his arm behind the 
      protecting screen which prevents that the patient can see the true position 
      of his arm.</font></p>

    <h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;hand-exteriorization&quot;-technique.</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(About safety 
      considerations please read Simon K's very good <a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://f27.parsimony.net/forum66412/messages/9.htm'))window.location='http://f27.parsimony.net/forum66412/messages/9.htm'" tppabs="http://f27.parsimony.net/forum66412/messages/9.htm" target="museon">submission</a> 
      to the Museum, [and my repy to it].)</font> 
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
      course, we can not use any local anesthetics, those are reserved for the 
      experienced medical practitioners.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      experts have devised a very simple but effective method, to facilitate experiments 
      with virtual limbs.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
      you need is an ordinary apparatus which is used to measure the blood pressure. 
      From this apparatus you need only the pressure cuff facility. You surely 
      already know those pressure cuff-manchettes which your doctor or your nurse 
      puts around your upper arm, when he's about to measure your blood pressure. 
      They will pump air into this manchette which forms a tight ring around your 
      arm preventing the blood from circulating in your arm veins. (Of course, 
      only the main blood-vessels are blocked, there remains enough circulation 
      in the smaller vessels, that almost normal functioning and supply of oxygen 
      to the arm tissues is possible). By this means you prevent the nerves to 
      function properly and the hand and arm gets numb i.e. the nerve impulses 
      are blocked temporarily from reaching your central nervous system (brain). 
      When the pressure-cuff is removed complete normal functioning of the nerve-fibers 
      is restored.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sit 
      at a table, put the arm on it, apply the pressure cuff to you upper arm 
      and inflate it. It is necessary to cover your arm with something to &quot;prevent 
      your brain&quot; from calculating the position of your arm by the visual 
      input; in other words: you should not be able to see what the exact position 
      of your arm is. You can accomplish this by covering the table with a black 
      cloth. (See picture):</font></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="arm.jpg" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/arm.jpg" width="523" height="631"></p>
    <p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
      can see in this picture, how the virtual limb begins to &quot;exteriorize&quot; 
      from the &quot;real&quot; arm. After 30 minutes the virtual arm begins to 
      move a bit, 10 minutes later its position is moved away quite a lot from 
      its original position.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
      some practice with this method it is no more necessary to cover your arm. 
      As soon as your hand and arm gets numb you will be able to move your virtual 
      hand and arm freely around. You can let it glide &quot;through the table&quot;, 
      you can grab your (&quot;real&quot;) nose and do all kind of funny experiments. 
      What about to enter your &quot;real&quot; body with your &quot;virtual hand&quot;. 
      Is this possible for you ? Can you &quot;feel&quot; your inner body segments? 
      (Remember Polynesian healers when they claim that they operate you and enter 
      your body to remove the evil spirit of your ailment ...). Are you able to 
      trick your virtual hand ? Can you feel the wetness of water in a drinking 
      glass or not? Can you reduce or expand the size of your hand and arm? Can 
      you remember the &quot;feeling&quot; of extracting your virtual limb and 
      do the same without the aid of the pressure cuff ? With practice you will 
      be able to extract your entire virtual body from his actual counterpart.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
      see: <b>What we learn by Bardons method is not to reach the &quot;astral

    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
      may say, that's the same thing explained with a new terminology. I disagree 
      ! Because I'm not satisfied with the implications of the old (and I think 
      outdated) notion of the astral (and mental) plane.</font></p>
