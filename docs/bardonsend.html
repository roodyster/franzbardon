    <h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Bardons body in very 
      bad conditions in the last decade of his life.</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
      know, that Franz Bardon was very ill in the last decade of his life.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      legend goes, that he had &quot;to work out&quot; the &quot;bad seeds of 
      karma&quot; of the real owner of his body. Most readers will know about 
      this legend, probably created by Otti Votavova (<a href="pictures.html#otti" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/pictures.html#otti" target="otti">see 
      photo</a>), Franz Bardons secretary and student, that Franz Bardon was a 
      highly evolved soul who was not born like any other ordinary human. No, 
      he entered the body of a boy in his puberty, to help in this way the father 
      of the boy, Victor Bardon, being a Christian mystic not able to proceed 
      further on the mystical path, and who longed for the true initiation by 
      an adept.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
      this legend it has been tried to explain the incongruency, of how a man 
      can become ill who claims almost unlimited psychic powers his own. Why, 
      it has been asked, didn't he heal himself, if all these &quot;magical&quot; 
      abilities have been at his disposal?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      answer is (= the legend continues), that it was forbidden to him by the 
      &quot;laws of karma&quot; to use his special abilities for himself. When 
      someone takes over the body of another person by advanced and secret means 
      which are unknown at that time, the overtaken body is bound to the laws 
      of that time. It would be an infringement of the law of evolution to use 
      advanced magical abilities to heal such a body, bound by his karma to become 
      ill. No one is allowed to use powers, which are not known at that time generally 
      to all, in such a case. And even Bardon, as a &quot;high initiate&quot;, 
      had to respect this law of evolution. Bardon tried once, reports Bardons 
      student &quot;Dr. M.K.&quot; (<a href="pictures.html#drmk" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/pictures.html#drmk" target="drmk">see 
      photo</a>) in his book, to circumvent this principle and took an alchemical 
      potion which he used for his patients to cure high blood pressure, just 
      to test, what the outcomes would be. As a result he suffered from low blood 
      pressure from this point on, which made his condition even worse.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
      won't comment here on this legend. I just like to say that this theory has 
      some shortcomings, e.g. why was then Bardon allowed to heal other people 
      with his psychic abilities? Were those persons not bound to the law of their 
      time? Furthermore : if we now learn these &quot;secret&quot; abilities, 
      are we allowed to use them to heal people or not? The answer to this question 
      must be yes, because Bardons first book contains extensive sections about 
      special methods to cure the sick.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, 
      we know from Dr. M.K's account, that Bardon was obese, he suffered from 
      high (low?) blood pressure and his pancreas was in very bad condition: he 
      suffered from sharp attacks of pancreatitis, a life-threatening ailment. 
      You can see on some of his pictures (not on my site), that indeed this man 
      makes a very sick impression. (What immediately catched my attention when 
      I saw those pictures for the first time is the fact, that on some photos 
      Bardon makes a very sick impression, but then on some other pictures taken 
      two years later, he seems completely recovered. On some photos he looks 
      quite old, then on such of a later date, he seems to be a lot younger. I 
      was never able to estimate which one of the photos had been taken before 
      or after another one.)</font></p>
    <h4 align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bardons 
      imprisonment.</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardons 
      final imprisonment in March, 26 1958 continues to remain a mystery. What 
      were the precise accusations that justified such a stark measure? We have 
      R&uuml;ggebergs account in his <a href="timscott.html" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/timscott.html" target="tim">letter 
      to Tim Scott</a>, who recounts Votavovas version, that Bardon was accused 
      of being a spy for the west. Dr. M.K. presents another version and writes 
      in &quot;Erinnerungen an Franz Bardon&quot; (German) = &quot;Souvenirs de 
      Franz Bardon&quot; (French), that Bardon was accused mainly of &quot;illegal 
      production of medicaments&quot;, because most of his medicines were based 
      on alchemical recipes. In a third version, Lumir Bardon says in the same 
      book, that Bardon was accused not to have paid taxes for the alcohol which 
      he used for his extraction of medicinal herbs and for treason, because in 
      a letter to Australia he had written something harmful about his country. 
      There exists even a fourth and more &quot;spiritual&quot; version, that 
      Bardons death had something to do with Otti Votavovas further &quot;Karma&quot; 
      on the inner planes (I cannot remember at the moment what the precise source 
      for this info is, as soon I find it, I will add it here.)</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Bardon was probably aware, that he was about to be arrested, because at 
      Christmas 1957 he told his son Lumir (<a href="pictures.html#lumir" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/pictures.html#lumir" target="lumir">see 
      photo</a>), never to think bad about him and never to believe the lies people 
      will tell him in the time to come. It is very probable that the secret service 
      of the former Tschechoslovakia was involved with Bardons imprisonment: Lumir 
      Bardon, the son of Franz Bardon writes in the above cited little book, that 
      after the death of Franz Bardon &quot;exponents of the secret services repeatedly 
      told him, what a bad fellow his father had been&quot;. Was involved even 
      the feared communist secret service (KGB) of the former soviet union? It 
      may indeed be the case: we all know how intimate all communist countries 
      collaborated during the cold war.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
      happened really in these horrible days? Were they about to use drugs on 
      him to uncover his secrets? We know that in Russia they were fervently researching 
      occultism and supernatural phenomena in search for means to oppose the steadily 
      rising economic and military power of the USA.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Dr.M.K recounts, that Bardon had many old manuscripts and books in his library, 
      some of them he was not allowed to read. One of these old manuscripts, Dr. 
      M.K. states, was a plain explanation of how to prepare the &quot;elixir 
      of life&quot;. Had rumors spread, that Bardon was in possession of such 
      a document, causing the greed of someone with the means to act against Bardon? 
      In fact, all his personal possessions have been confiscated, his golden 
      rings, talismans were never returned to Bardons family. He was even dissected 
      <b>two</b> times. Strange things must have been happened in those days, 
      because one of the investigation agents of the local police asked, when 
      he was handing over the few items which were returned to Bardons family, 
      if they knew who had ordered the second dissection of Bardons corpse. What 
      was here going on?</font></p>
    <h4 align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bardons 
      death</font></h4>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Bardon had been imprisoned for about 4 months until he, ... , suddenly, 
      ..., died.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most 
      &quot;interesting&quot; (?!?) in this regard is the fact that Bardon ordered 
      three days before his death, that his wife Marie (<a href="pictures.html#otti" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/pictures.html#otti" target="marie">see 
      photo</a>) should send him a piece of &quot;Speck&quot; (that is a local 
      special preparation of very fat bacon) into his prison because he has an 
      &quot;appetite&quot; for it. Now, you know, bacon is literally POISON for 
      someone who suffers from pancreatitis. Just check this out in any ordinary 
      medical textbook. And Bardon was not a stupid one. He was even a professional 
      healer, so it is 100% for sure, that he knew precisely what the consequences 
      must be. Lumir Bardon recounts that &quot;father got sharp pains in his 
      abdomen, but the guards thought that he was just simulating. Only after 
      three days of most severe cramps, they moved him to the army hospital at 
      Brno<a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/bardonsuicide.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/bardonsuicide.html#mendel'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/bardonsuicide.html#mendel" target="brino"><b>*</b></a> 
      (<a href="pictures.html#opava" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/pictures.html#opava" target="brno">see 
      map</a>), where he died in July, 10 1958 of pancreatitis.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's 
      indeed my impression, that Bardon committed a &quot;smart type&quot; of 
      suicide to escape his persecutors.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Had 
      he been dissected to check out if he took some kind of poison? Or were they 
      in search for something else? We don't know.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      It's my impression that this way Bardon even with his death showed his superior 
      intelligence and he won his final battle against his enemies: a simple piece 
      of bacon was all he needed to trick and to escape his persecutors. But we 
      never will know the truth behind these very sad events.</font></p>

      Did you know that the father of genetics, the Augustinian monk <b>Gregor 
      Mendel</b> (1822-1884) lived and made his revolutionary experiments on genetics 
      in Brno (= Brino, the pronunciation of the &quot;i&quot; is like the &quot;i&quot; 
      in &quot;m<u>i</u>lk&quot;), and that he studied 2 years in Olomouc (Olm&uuml;tz) 
      very near to <b>Opava</b>, Franz Bardons home town? You see &quot;spiritual 
      energy&quot; is on a very high level in this area. (That's no scientific 
      statement, of course, I'm sorry for this slip ... ) </font></p>
