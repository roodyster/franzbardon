<p>However interested we may feel in the other strange accomplishments
with which Tibetan adepts of the secret lore are credited, the <b>creation
of thought forms</b> seems by far the most puzzling.
<p>...
<p>Phantoms, as Tibetans describe them, and those that I have myself seen
do not resemble the apparitions which are said to occur during spiritualist
seances.
<p>As I have said, some apparitions are created on purpose either by a
lengthy process resembling that described in the former chapter on the
visualization of <i>Ydam</i> or, in the case of proficient adepts, instantaneously
or almost instantaneously. In other cases, apparently the author of the
phenomenon generates it unconsciously, and is not even in the least aware
of the apparition being seen by others.
<p><b><u>However, the practice is considered as fraught with danger for
every one who has not reached a high mental and spiritual degree of enlightenment
and is not fully aware of the nature of the psychic forces at work in the
process.</u></b>
<p>Once the <i>tulpa</i> is endowed with enough vitality to be capable
of playing the part of a real being, it tends to free itself from its maker's
control. This, say Tibetan occultists, happens nearly mechanically, just
as the child, when his body is completed and able to live apart, leaves
its mother's womb. Sometimes the phantom becomes a rebellious son and one
hears of uncanny struggles that have taken place between magicians and
their creatures, the former being severely hurt or even killed by the latter.
<p>Tibetan magicians also relate cases in which the <i>tulpa</i> is sent
to fulfil a mission, but does not come back and pursues its peregrinations
as a half-conscious, dangerously mischievous puppet. The same thing, it
is said, may happen when the maker of the <i>tulpa</i> dies before having
dissolved it. Yet as a rule the phantom either disappears suddenly at the
death of the magician or gradually vanishes like a body that perishes for
want of food. On the other hand, some <i>tulpas</i> are expressly intended
to survive their creator and are specially formed for that purpose.
<p>...
<p>Must we credit these strange accounts of rebellious "materializations",
phantoms which have become real beings, or must we reject them all as mere
fantastic tales and wild products of imagination? -
<p>Perhaps the latter course is the wisest. I affirm nothing. I only relate
what I have heard from people whom, in other circumstances, I had found
trustworthy, but they may have deluded themselves in all sincerity.
<p>Nevertheless, allowing for a great deal of exaggeration and sensational
addition, I could hardly deny the possibility of visualizing and animating
a <i>tulpa</i>. Besides having had few opportunities of seeing thought-forms,
my habitual incredulity led me to make experiments for myself, and my efforts
were attended with some success. In order to avoid being influenced by
the forms of the lamaist deities, which I saw daily around me in paintings
and images, I chose for my experiment a most insignificant character: a
Monk, short and fat, of an innocent and jolly type.
<p>I shut myself in <i>tsams</i> and proceeded to perform the prescribed
concentration of thought and other rites. After a few months the phantom
Monk was formed. His form grew gradually <i>fixed</i> and lifelike looking.
He became a kind of guest, living in my apartment. I then broke my seclusion
and started for a tour, with my servants and tents.
<p>The Monk included himself in the party. Though I lived in the open,
riding on horseback for miles each day, the illusion persisted. I saw the
fat <i>trapa</i>, now and then it was not necessary for me to think of
him to make him appear. The phantom performed various actions of the kind
that are natural to travelers and that I had not commanded. For instance,
he walked, stopped, looked around him. The illusion was mostly visual,
but sometimes I felt as if a robe was lightly rubbing against me and once
a hand seemed to touch my shoulder.
<p>The features which I had imagined, when building my phantom, gradually
underwent a change. The fat, chubby-cheeked fellow grew leaner, his face
assumed a vaguely mocking, sly, malignant look. He became more troublesome
and bold. In brief, he escaped my control. Once, a herdsman who brought
me a present of butter saw the <i>tulpa</i> in my tent and took it for
a living lama.
<p>I ought to have let the phenomenon follow its course, but the presence
of that unwanted companion began to prove trying to my nerves; it turned
into a "day-nightmare". Moreover, I was beginning to plan my journey to
Lhasa and needed a quiet brain devoid of other preoccupations, so I decided
to dissolve the phantom. I succeeded, but only after <b>six months</b>
of <b>hard struggle</b>. My mind-creature was tenacious of life.
<p>There is nothing strange in the fact that I may have created my own
hallucination. The interesting point is that in these cases of materialization,
others see the thought-forms that have been created.
<p>...
<p>In connection with these kinds of visualization or thought-form creation,
I may relate a few phenomena which I have witnessed myself:
<p>1.
<p>A young Tibetan who was in my service went to see his family. I had
granted him three weeks' leave, after which he was to purchase a food supply,
engage porters to carry the loads across the hills, and come back with
the caravan.
<p>Most likely the fellow had a good time with his people. Two months elapsed
and still he did not return. I thought he had definitely left me. Then
I saw him one night in a dream. He arrived at my place clad in a somewhat
unusual fashion, wearing a sun hat of foreign shape. He had never worn
such a hat. The next morning, one of my servants came to me in haste. "Wangdu
has come back" he told me. "I have just seen him down the hill".
<p>The coincidence was strange. I went out of my room to look at the traveler.
The place where I stood dominated a valley. I distinctly saw Wang-du. He
was dressed exactly as I had seen him in my dream. He was alone and walking
slowly up the path that wound up the hill slope. I remarked that he had
no luggage with him and the servant who was next me answered: "Wangdu has
walked ahead, the load-carriers bust be following."
<p>We both continued to observe the man. He reached a small <i>ch&ouml;rten</i>,
walked behind it and did not reappear. The base of this <i>ch&ouml;rten</i>
was a cube built in stone, less than three feet high, and from its needle-shaped
top to the ground, the small monument was no more than seven feet high.
There was no cavity in it. Moreover, the <i>ch&ouml;rten</i> was completely
isolated: there were neither houses, nor trees, nor undulations, nor anything
that could provide a hiding in the vicinity.
<p>My servant and I believed that Wangdu was resting for a while under
the shade of the <i>ch&ouml;rten</i>. But as the time went by without his
reappearing, I inspected the ground round the monument with my field glasses,
but discovered nobody. Very much puzzled I sent two of my servants to search
for the boy. I followed their movements with the glasses but no trace was
to be found of Wangdu nor of anybody else.
<p>That same day a little before dusk the young man appeared in the valley
with his caravan. He wore the very same dress and the foreign sun hat which
I had seen in my dream, and in the morning vision. Without giving him or
the load-carriers time to speak with my servants and bear about the phenomenon,
I immediately questioned them. From their answers I learned that all of
them had spent the previous night in a place too far distant from my dwelling
for anyone to reach the latter in the morning. It was also clearly stated
that Wangdu had continually walked with the party.
<p>During the following weeks I was able to verify the accuracy of the
men's declarations by inquiring about the time of the caravan's departure,
at the few last stages where the porters were changed. It was proved that
they had all spoken the truth and had left the last stage together with
Wangdu, as they said.
<p>2.
<p>A Tibetan painter, a fervent worshipper of the wrathful deities, who
took a peculiar delight in drawing their terrible forms, came one afternoon
to pay me a visit. I noticed behind him the somewhat nebulous shape of
one of the fantastic beings which often appeared in his paintings.
<p>I made a startled gesture and the astonished artist took a few steps
towards me, asking what was the matter. I noticed that the phantom did
not follow him, and quickly thrusting my visitor aside, I walked to the
apparition with one arm stretched in front of me. My hand reached the foggy
form. I felt as if touching a soft object whose substance gave way under
the slight push, and the vision vanished.
<p>The painter confessed in answer to my questions that he had been performing
a <i>dubthab</i> rite during the last few weeks, calling on the deity whose
form I had dimly perceived, and that very day he bad worked the whole morning
on a painting of the same deity.
<p>In fact, the Tibetan's thoughts were entirely concentrated on the deity
whose help he wished to secure for a rather mischievous undertaking. He
himself had not seen the phantom.
<p>In these two cases, the Phenomenon was produced without the conscious
co-operation of its author. Or, as a mystic lama remarked, Wangdu and the
painter could hardly be termed the authors of the phenomena. They were
but one cause - maybe the principal one - amongst the various causes which
had brought them about.
<p>3.
<p>The third strange occurrence I have to relate belongs to the category
of phenomena which are voluntarily produced. The fact that the apparition
appeared in the likeness of the lama who caused it, must not lead us to
think that he projected a subtle double of himself. This is not the opinion
of advanced adepts in Tibetan secret lore.
<p>According to them such phantoms are <i>tulpas</i>, magic formations
generated by a powerful concentration of thoughts. As it has been repeatedly
stated in the preceding chapters, any forms may be visualized through that
process.
<p>At that time I was camping near Punag <i>rit&ouml;d</i> in Kham. One
afternoon, I was with my cook in a hut which we used as a kitchen. The
boy asked me for some provisions. I answered, 'Come with me to my tent,
you can take what you need out of the boxes.'
<p>We walked out and when nearing my tent, we both saw the hermit lama
seated on a folding chair next my camp table. This did not surprise us
because the lama often came to talk with me. The cook only said 'Rimpoche
is there, I must go and make tea for him at once, I will take the provisions
later on.'
<p>I replied: 'All right. Make tea and bring it to us.'
<p>The man turned back and I continued to walk straight toward the lama,
looking at him all the time while he remained seated motionless. When I
was only a few steps from the tent, a flimsy veil of mist seemed to open
before it, like a curtain that is slowly pulled aside. And suddenly I did
not see the lama any more. He had vanished.
<p>A little later, the cook came, bringing tea. He was surprised to see me alone. 
  As I did not like to frighten him I said: 'Rimpoche only wanted to give me a 
  message. He had no time to stay to tea.' I related the vision to the lama, but 
  he only laughed at me without answering my questions. Yet, upon another occasion 
  he repeated the phenomenon. He utterly disappeared as I was speaking with him 
  in the middle of a wide bare track of land, without tent or houses or any kind 
  of shelter in the vicinity.
