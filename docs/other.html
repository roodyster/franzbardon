<a NAME="moryason"></a>ALEXANDRE MORYASON</h2>
(contributed by Patrick from France, 8. August 1997)
<p>I practice Franz Bardons teachings with a french book "La Lumiere sur
le royaume" (Light on the Realm). The author seems to know really well
everything about FB. He gives many rituals that I use, inspired but not
similar to Golden Dawn ones.
<p>I have read a ton of books about magic and esoterism in general and
the best I have found is, without a single doubt 'La lumiere sur le Royaume',
the book which I talked you about. The author, Alexandre Moryason describes
a complete but simple magic system to purify the whole body (physical,
astral,mental).
<p>He says that the best thing to do is to practice the rituals that he
describes WITH FB's teachings. And if you do so, you'll be contacted (???)
in a way or another, by him.
<p>The rituals are simple and easy to achieve. They are similar for some
parts, to Golden Dawn's one, but only with the active parts (that's anyway
my interpretation).
<p>Alexandre Moryason seems to have many, many informations about Franz
Bardon. But what is very interesting, is that HE HAS TRANSLATED ALL HIS
BOOKS (into French), and 'souvenirs...'. And for each page, you have his
personal notes which clarify some points. He makes parallel with Eastern
traditions, that he seems to know very well. These notes are very complete
and, as always, clear.
<p>I wish you could read French, becouse I am sure that you would appreciate
a lot the translation.

<p>Mr. Konstantinos on Franz Bardon:
<blockquote>"In my opinion, his methods of teaching and the techniques
he explains are the best found in modern occultism. Although difficult
to attain, he explains that the true goal of a magician is to become an
adept; not to just perform interesting rituals."</blockquote>
Mr. Konstantinos on his book "Summoning Spirits: The Art of Magical Evocation":
<blockquote>In my book I give a complete training technique that does not
require the amount of training Bardon required. While Bardon was probably
the greatest adept of the 20th century, and working his training methods
can help one down a similar path, it is not necessary to become an adept
to evoke entities. Judging by reader mail, it takes about two months of
serious effort to work the initial results described in Summoning Spirits.
<p>Bright Blessings, Konstantinos</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<p>Peter Dexheimer published in 1995 his book "Energiearbeit" = "Energywork"
which basically describes a special method to use Franz Bardon's quabbalistic
formulas. This method was first devised by Cuno-H. M&uuml;ller and extensively
used by the Bardon-M&uuml;ller Liga (BML) in the '60- and '70. (See also
R&uuml;ggeberg's comment on the <a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/rueggebe.html'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/rueggebe.html#bml'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/rueggebe.html#bml">BML</a>.)
<p>Cuno-H. M&uuml;ller ignored Bardon's warnings to practice the quabbalistic
formulas without proper preparation. Peter Dexheimer now discusses M&uuml;ller's
method extensively in the 5 volumes of "Energywork".
<p>In summary: the quabbalistic formulas of Bardon are repeated like mantras
in a way which is called "Japa-Joga" in the Indian Joga terminology. By
this repetition the connected qualities are believed to be realized after
a certain number of repetitions. Japa-Joga is in my opinion a VERY POWERFUL
tool, especially for beginners, because no special magical training is
required and everyone can immediately begin to realize his wishes. And
it is a very safe method (in my opinion). I did Japa-Joga for long times
and got only positive results (I was inspired 20 years ago by the Indian
jogi Swami Muktananda, who was able to realize very high states of consciousness
with this method). This method is almost unknown in the western world and
therefore I appreciate Dexheimer's book.
<br>Yet Mr. Dexheimer has a different point of view: he thinks, that practicing
Cuno-H. M&uuml;ller's method is quabbalistic work as intended by Bardon.
Everyone may decide on his own experience and reasoning.
<br>But please consider R&uuml;ggeberg's warnings before you decide to
practice it. Mr. Stenjar also warns against this method, because he believes
that there may be long-term harms.

<a NAME="keys"></a>Source of the "Quantity Key's" of the Sem-Ham-Phorash

Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) (See also: <a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/kir_jpg.html'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/kir_jpg.html'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/kir_jpg.html">Athanasius
Kircher</a>) was a scholar in the old sense, looking at knowledge as a
whole rather than specialising in one field. He also tried to bring all
he knew into one philosophical whole. A criticism could be that he was
a magpie, taking whatever he came across and putting it towards his worldview
rather than being discriminatory. All knowledge is good knowledge ?
<br>He produced various works concerning Alchemy etc etc please refer to
the book and reference list.
<br>Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652-1654) is the work that interests us here.
In my semi biography or introduction to his works there is an arresting
diagram. It claims to show the names and relationships of the 72 spirits
of Mercury.
<br>What is astonishing is that <b>it reveals the quantity key's</b> as
given in KTQ.
<p>AK states the second circle shows the names of god in the various languages
of the earth. Look at no.23 for Angli (English) and next door for Hyberni
(Scottish) It stretches the bounds of credibility that all these words
are the name of god in that locale. But I'll let it pass. At the top of
the diagram on the leaves are 3 letter combinations in Hebrew script. (These
are the names of the mercurial spirits without the -al or -iah suffix of
the angelic names.) Note in the commentary at the bottom of the page "On
no account to be used for magical invocations". The books title is Athanasius
Kircher. A Renaissance Man and the Quest for Lost Knowledge." Published
in the UK by Thames &amp; Hudson in 1979. Author, Joscelyn Godwin. (ISBN
0500 81022 2 ).
<p>(I would like to thank Mr. Paul M. for the contribution of this introduction
to AK and for the scan of the diagram. Paul M. was the first one who actually
noticed Bardon's quantity keys on AK's diagram. PA)

<p>Mahavatar Babaji</center>

<p>by Daniel S.
<br>(January, 14. 1998)
<p>Have you ever looked at what might be a unique connection between the
person known as Franz Bardon, and the life of the Siddhar named Boganathar
(Bogar).... both have a biographic relationship to Lao Tzu.
<br>Bogar was the person who initiated Mahmuni Babaji the deathless saint
of Badrinath.... Bogar exited the body and entered the body of a boy that
was dying in China called Lao Tzu.... This seems to be an accepted fact
by the followers of Bogar... There is also mention about him in Babaji
and the 18 Tamil Siddhars. There is a striking resemblance in character.
Here is a short account of the Tamil Siddhars with some mention of him...
The more I read about them, the more the connection makes sense.
