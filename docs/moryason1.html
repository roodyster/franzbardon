<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"T.N." 
  stands for "Translator's Note", which is inscribed in the French edition's footnotes 
  as "Ndt". The Translator thus referred to is that who translated the text into 
  French, providing me with my original, French language material. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In this document, 
    the footnotes, translated into English from the actual of the French language 
    edition, are preceded by the Word "Page" followed by the number of the page 
    on which they do appear in the French language, that followed by words or 
    phrases as relevant for clarity's sake, immediately preceding the call for 
    a given footnote, thusly: the French word or phrase, then its English rendition, 
    then the call for the footnote, all in Bold type but the body of the footnotes 
    themselves; the latter are in Roman but for their call number, as in the French 
    language edition. For example, in the French edition's main text on page 51, 
    the word "Ame" is followed by a call for footnote I and further down page 
    51, there appears the phrase "matrice astrale", followed by the call for footnote 
    2; so, I write then "Page 51, "Ame", "Soul"'; "matrice astrale","astral matrix"2". 
    Following such a statement comes, in a distinct paragraph and the order called, 
    any footnote for that page. </font>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Reminder: There 
    are references to a specific other page of the book. That specific other page 
    is stated as to the pagination of the French edition used. Please do effect 
    the adequate transposition in the page numbers. Thus, in Note I of page 60, 
    there is a reference to Note I of page 56, both those pages 60 and 56 being 
    of the same French edition. Likewise, a footnote on page 393 refers to another 
    on page 380. </font>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">There is another 
    such reference on page 256 of the French edition I used, to a note allegedly 
    on page 273 where there is actually no note: In fact, the note referred to 
    on page 256 as being on page 273 appears on page 275. It is about Yidams, 
    as is the page 256 note; I therefore wrote "page 275" instead of "273" in 
    the page 256 note of my English footnote text. </font>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On page 347, 
    the footnote refers to pages 259 and 263 of an earlier French edition.</font>

  31, "&Eacute;ther", "Ether"<sup>1</sup>.</b> </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1) TN.: Western 
    hermetic texts, following the Greek texts, called for a long time "Ether" 
    (Aither) what the Orient calls "Akasha". However, for more than a century 
    by now, it has been the usage to attribute to the word "Akasha" the meaning 
    of "Divine Primordial Substance", "Sole Spirit, Source of the whole Creation", 
    while the word "Ether" currently designates subtle and invisible indeed but 
    very dense a plane in comparison with the other, higher planes; what is involved 
    is a plane of quasi-physical a nature, the closest plane to physical nature. 
    The etheric plane is born, it is true, as all other planes, from the Akasha 
    (Divine Source). Nevertheless, aiming at the practice and therefore the readers'real 
    development, Franz Bardon did not linger making explicit all the subtle planes 
    (with their respective hues, the sub-planes, etc) in order not to encase Hermetic 
    Science into essentially intellectual an understanding. That is why he uses 
    the word Akasha or Ether while giving it several meanings, according to the 
    context: "Pre-material etheric plane" or "Entirety of all the subtle planes" 
    or yet "Infinite Divine Source" (an Aspect that is, from the vibratory standpoint, 
    infinitely, inconceivably higher than the quasi-physical etheric plane). <br>

    magnet which we know is a ferro-magnetic body having its own magnetic field, 
    and 2 poles called conventionally "North" and "South" according to their orientation 
    within the terrestrial magnetic field. It therefore does not correspond exactly 
    to what F. Bardon calls a "four-pole magnet". However, all over this work, 
    we shall stick to that phrase in order to remain faithful to the concept developed 
    by the Author. <br>

    is the sad truth. It is fitting however to wonder "why" black wizards or magicians 
    utilize those substances... Precisely because they contain, on the material 
    plane, the refiexion of the Akasha, Divine Energy pre-eminently! It was therefore 
    in order to feed their rites that they so avidly sought blood and sperm...

    the phrase "Guardian Angel" and which is also called "Soul", in the veritable 
    sense and with the latter's attributes: Protection, teaching, immortality, 
    etc. The word "astral" was designating what we now call etheric and the psychical 
    plane (immediately superior to the etheric, in the current sense) was the 
    Plane of Desire, expressing itself in particular in the human being by the 
    body of desire. The latter is now called "astral or psychical body". In consequence, 
    must be understood here by astral body: Psychical body or body of desire,

    "astral" was appearing alone in the first translation. However, on account 
    of the complexity of the subtle planes, it is fitting to be more precise, 
    given the descriptions, themselves very precise, which the author makes for 
    us of those planes. That is why the word "etheric" was added, for it is both 
    those planes, astral and etheric, that are involved here. Therefore, over 
    these pages, we took the liberty to put the exact term attributed to each 
    of those planes today for a better understanding by the reader. Moreover, 
    the phrase "Fourth Dimension" currently designates all the subtle planes (immaterial 
    and invisible for the human being, Akasha included), that are also called 
    in an imprecise manner, "Beyond". The prevailing hierarchy must therefore 
    be restituted there as to the different planes from the densest to the highest: 
    0) The physical body (which is not a Principle!) 1) The etheric body 2) The 
    astral or psychical body 3) The mental body (divided into lower or concrete 
    mental and higher mental or Causal, Egoic body, Soul) 4) The Buddhic body 
    5) The Atmic body 6) The Monad 7) the Primary Divine Spark: Adi. <br>

    the medium yields his etheric hand (indeed his whole bod ...) and in that 
    case, it is the spirits living on that relatively dense although invisible 
    plane that use that hand; the nature and the degree of evolution of those 
    spirits, account taken of the plane to which they belong, therefore leave 
    to be desired and contact is in general very harmful. The Magus or student 
    in Magic yields his mental hand; that means that from that high plane, a spirit 
    residing there will act or manifest himself "<b>by tuning into</b>" the etheric 
    hand (which stayed in the physical hand) that then will cause the physical 
    hand to move according to the instructions come from that high plane; in consequence, 
    under that method, the spirit does not enter into the hand of the Magus. He 
    guides it "by tuning" according to the Law of Analogy ruling all the planes. 
    The mental plane being what is involved, those are beings living on that high 
    sphere that the Magus contacts. </font>

    specify that that mode of communication, even if, a priori, it makes possible 
    to contact living beings on the mental plane, does not avoid "static" by beings 
    residing on the psychical or etheric plane. In fact, when a mental organ (here, 
    the hand) leaves its astral and physical envelope, the void thus created is 
    immediately compensated for by a vibratory extension of the concerned organ's 
    psychical and etheric aura; in consequence, that extension necessarily attracts 
    beings residing on those planes, inferior to the mentdl sphere, that shall 
    attempt to manifest themselves too and may perturb the reception of the message 
    receivedfrom the mental plane. Because the Magus is aware of that phenomenon, 
    he does not let himself be drawn into that noxious current. He exercises his 
    vigilance and does not have an attitude of total submission and credulity 
    towards what he picks up. "at is therefore involved there is a simple exercise 
    making it possible to experiment and to convince oneset(of the existence of 
    beings on invisible planes. Other, surer means, linked to the development 
    of the psychical and above all mental senses, enable the human being to contact

    (therefore, relatively dense) plane, that is in no wise the decedent's and 
    that makes a game of the medium and of the audience. Another category of Ghosts 
    is that whose shape is the defunct's real etheric body which, on account o 
    its density linked to the paucity of evolution of the person in question, 
    desagregates itself very slowly while that person's Consciousness is elsewhere

    used, at the start, to act: the dense planes (considered in relation to the 
    spiritual planes, beyond the mental plane) being involved, that is to say 
    the etheric, psychical or astral and mental planes, even an "ill-directed" 
    (working with the dark forces) person can develop those powers. The Siddhis

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1) TN.: The action 
    of Fire (by the sight of a frightful image or scene) or the electro-magnetic 
    power's, provokes a "shock" that distends the etheric link between a person's 
    physical brain and mental body. In that sense, one can speak of a recollection's 
    obliteration or destruction. This phenomenon is temporary however, when one 
    considers a series of lives: one can indeed lose memory during a whole incarnation 
    but, actually, in the pure etheric substance (a given System's Akashic Archives 
    that are obliterated - or rather absorbed by a Great Logos - only at the Great 
    Pralaya's time), nothing is obliterated nor destroyed; it is only the etheric 
    link, enabling the reading of what was recorded there, which is altered. This 
    can happen either by a magical action or following an intense fear or an immense 
    sorrow; nevertheless, those are the same Powers that provoke the phenomena: 
    Fire (by a horrible sight) or electro-magnetism (prompted by the shock's intensity).</font>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1) TN.: Indeed, 
    Mankind, as a global entity, has a Karma (Mankind's Karma) that permits or 
    forbids, at a given time, the spreading of a knowledge, of a science, of a 
    technique, liable to ease its life, alleviate its sufferings, etc... for those 
    trials are deserved and lead to the evolution of the Collective Consciousness. 
    The wars, the epidemics, the struggles for Freedom, of these last two centuries, 
    balanced a retributive Karma and thus made possible the acceleration of the 
    scientific "discoveries",&nbsp; of the quality and of the generalization of 
    the analgesics, of the technological progresses; those are factors that completely 
    transformed life in a physical body and the material environment of the individuals. 
    If therefore a Magus divulges a knowledge while "the karmic hour" has not 
    come for Mankind yet, he incurs a risk..., but generally the Magus remains 
    silent and uses his knowledgefor himself and in the event for his own; that 
    is not egoism but mere knowledge of the Law.</font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
