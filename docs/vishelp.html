<hr>
<p>In this section I would like to present 2 methods that may help you
develope your visualisation skills.
<br>
<hr>
<center>
<h2>
First method: A "trick" devised by W.E. Butler.</h2></center>
The following advice to practice visualization exercises was published
by W.E. Butler in his book "The Magician. His Training and Work." 1959,
(Part II, chapter 4: Visualization and Audition).
<center>
<p>------------</center>

<p><b>W.E. Butler (in "The Magician. His Training and Work."):</b>
<p>The present writer has found that one of the best ways of carrying out
the first part of this exercise is to place the object in a good light
on a monochrome surface, either dark or light, and use a paper or cardboard
tube some eight inches long and two and a half inches inside diameter,
though which to gaze at it, using the left and right eyes alternately.
Or the tube may be made rectangular, so that both eyes may be used at the
same time.
<br>(Addition by Paul Allen: I used 2 tubes: one for the left and one for
the right eye. Additionally I used for a while a rectangular tube. Furthermore
I used also field-glasses with a small amplifying ratio.)
<p>Then, as the object is steadily held in the field of vision, the eyes
should be slightly thrown out of focus, as we sometimes do when we are
"day-dreaming", and the visual picture now apparently brought mentally
within the head. This is a psychological "trick" which is usually only
acquired after a great deal of effort and failure.
<p>It is analogus to the knack of learning to balance when we first attempt
to ride a bicycle. Once the knack has been gained, it will be found increasingly
easy to bring this mental image into mental apprehencion. A further development
is to close the eyes-during the first attempts only slightly, then more
fully in subsequent ones, until the final stage is reached when the student
is able to see clearly inside his head, as it were, the picture of the
object concerned, his eyes being closed in the meantime.
<p>Once this had been accomplished, and practice has made it fairly easy,
the complementary half should be essayed. The object chosen should be observed,
and the perception transferred in the usual way to the subjective mental
screen. Meanwhile a monochrome surface, such as a white disc on a black
backround or a black disc on a white surround, or a crystal or black concave
mirror, should have been placed so that the student can use it as a screen
upon which to project his mental picture. He should now open his eyes sufficiently
to see the disc or mirror (which should be in a dim light) whilst still
holding the picture on the mental screen. Then by a quiet, calm effort
of will he should project the picture outwardly onto the screen.
<br>Again there is a psychological knack to be gained, but once it is gained,
and stabilised by subsequent practise, a very great step forward has been
taken. It must again emphasised that this projection should be done deliberately
at the will of the apprentice magician and any involuntary projections
should be sternly resisted. When the knack has been gained, it is possible
to project such a mental image so clearly that it is to all intents and
purposes as though one were perceiving it with the psysical eyes.
<p>(... end text by Butler).

<p>------------</center>

<p>(Then Butler proceeds with explanations on how these pictures should
be "materialized" by the projection of ectoplasma and other similar subjects.)

<h2>
Second method: The flashing colors-method.</h2></center>
One problem of persons who are very poor at visualization is that they
simply don't know how or "on what" they should concentrate when they begin
to practice visualization exercises. Here follows a method by P.B. Randolph
described in his "Magia Sexualis" (chapter "Volantia"). This method is
known as the "flashing colors" method as detailed by the Golden Down people.
<br>If one concentrates on the afterimages which appear and disappear repeatedly
then he learns to concentrate on a visual phenomenon which comes very close
to the mental process that is involved when concentrating on imagined visual
pictures:
<ol>
<li>
The student learns to pierce intensly on a given picture for an extended
time interval.</li>

<li>
The student learns that imagined pictures dissapear and reappear when he
continues to focus his attention on the imagined item (picture).</li>

<li>
No time is wasted in the beginning when the student does not see anything
in his imagination when he begins to practice visualization exercises.</li>
</ol>
After the method by Randolph I will present some symbols in different colors
and/or backgrounds so that everyone can immediately test if he likes this
method or not.
<center>
<p>------------</center>

<p><b>P.B. Randolph (in "Magia Sexualis"; chapter "Volantia"):</b>
<p>One hangs a white disc on the wall, which is black at the centre. One
stares at the black centre of the disc for 60 seconds, remaining perfectly
motionless. This fortifies the capacity for concentration in the student
and also his attention. When the prescribed minute elapses, one turns the
face without changing the position of the eyes towards a white surface,
on which the optical illusion we see is the same disc, but the colours
are reversed, the background is black with the centre being white.
<p>The illusory vision disappears after a few seconds, and is repeated
again if one persists without moving. One must look at the disc <b>four
times</b> and, later on, <b>seven times</b>. When the student has become
familiar with this first exercise, he should repeat it with other discs,
coloured successive in the order of the spectrum of the colours of the
arch of heaven. Thus he develops these three capacities: attention, concentration,
and attraction.
<p>Five or six months later if he methodically exercises every day the
student will have acquired the capacity to create, in calmly staring at
a white surface, a mental form clothed in a corresponding astral body.
This body will manifest before the student so that communication is established
between the two.
<p>The same exercise may be made with the aid of a magic mirror, in the
middle of which is fixed a small white disc. The willed effect is thus
obtained more easily and quickly: a figure appears suddenly on the polished
surface of the mirror and you may question this figure that you see.
<p>(... end text by Randolph).

<p>Try one of these symbols to test Randolph's method.</center>

<p>(Here it's not the place to discuss if these "flashing colors" are really
"astral" in nature, as the Golden Down people think. PA)
