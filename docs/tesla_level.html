    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      I put some time ago the article about the Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) 
      on my website, I thought, that most people would recognize immediately the 
      relevance of these new scientific findings.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
      after a number of email discussions about this topic I soon found out that 
      many people didn't realize at all, for what reason I put the CBS article 
      on my site or for what end it was intended.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore 
      I have decided to summarize here the most important points in the hopes 
      that they will stimulate further discussion on this topic.</font></p>

      The disproved prejudice:</font></h3>
    <h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hallucinations, 
      visualization and, more in general, imagination as insane mental states.</font></h3>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
      first I would like to write about a common and widespread <b>prejudice</b>, 
      which is very well <b>disproved</b> by the article on the CBS.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
      all know that hallucinations are commonly associated with many mental disorders 
      like Schizophrenia, psychotic breakdown, the Parkinson disorder (the sooner 
      hallucinations begin to manifest and the more frequent they are, the worse 
      is the prognosis, i.e. the faster is the progress of this mental illness), 
      brain-degeneration of the elderly (dementia), extreme conditions of the 
      body like high fever, severe exhaustion, hunger or pain, and also the delirium 
      tremens of alcoholic-addicts in terminal conditions.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise 
      also many psychedelic drugs produce severe hallucinations, drugs like LSD, 
      the Psylocibin contained in a number of different species of fungi, the 
      Mescalin contained in some cacti and the Ahayahuasca (made from a combination 
      of different plant extracts; the effective ingredient is a tropical liana), 
      to name only some of the most important ones.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore 
      the word &quot;hallucination&quot; is in the public opinion mostly associated 
      with devaluating implications as of sickness, mental disorder, madness, 
      drug-abuse and so on, all notions that connote a very negative concept.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      But we know that most esoteric traditions involve special methods to create 
      exactly such hallucinations and this causes in most people, who are working 
      with those methods, many preoccupations and fears.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
      prevent these fears and preoccupations most systems avoid the word &quot;hallucination&quot; 
      and replace it with some other term like &quot;visualization&quot;, &quot;lesser&quot; 
      or &quot;greater&quot; &quot;ritual of the pentagram&quot;, &quot;recapitulation&quot;, 
      &quot;mandala meditation&quot;, or whatever.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless 
      most students intuitively understand very well</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      that also with these methods is involved exactly the production of hallucinations, 
      and therefore a number of different fears and preoccupations become dominant, 
      even if they remain confined sometimes to a subconscious level or they get 
      repressed to the subconscious (&quot;don't-want-do-think-about-it&quot;) 
      domain. This can result in a profound (and often unnoticed) resistance of 
      the subconscious part of a persons personality, which make success with 
      this special system very difficult or even impossible, especially if the 
      subconscious reaches the conclusion, that an insane state or other damage 
      may be the outcome of the training.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      Richard Bandler puts it very clearly: &quot;When the subconscious gets in 
      conflict with the conscious part of the personality, then the winning part 
      is always the subconscious.&quot; I would alter Bandler's &quot;always&quot; 
      to a &quot;most often&quot;, but in essence he is absolutely right. For 
      this reason it's so difficult, to maintain a wish or command established 
      by the conscious &quot;I&quot; against deeply rooted subconscious patterns, 
      for example to reduce the body weight or to quit smoking.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
      the subconscious decides, that &quot;success&quot; with a certain method 
      will result in a very dangerous outcome to the entire personality, then 
      it is almost impossible, to circumvent with our conscious &quot;will&quot; 
      this decision because the subconscious has always the ability to &quot;torpedate&quot; 
      with manifold means our conscious actions and decisions (e.g.: &quot;Today 
      I have no time to practice, I will do it tomorrow or even better, next week&quot;, 
      etc, we all know many examples of this kind of excuses ...).</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
      this point now, <a href="CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html" target="cbse">the 
      article by Teunisse et al. on the CBS</a> can be a very valuable contribution 
      to abolish this common prejudice that hallucinations are always associated 
      with mental disorders or with a disorder of the brain.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 
      though the CBS is produced by a degeneration of the visual system, it is 
      not associated with any of the fear-provoking features of common mental 
      disorders (like the loss of control as associated with Schizophrenia and 
      the like, or getting absorbed into hallucinatory delusions, paranoia, etc.); 
      in other words: people manifesting the CBS <u>are neurologically and mentally 
      completely sane</u>, though they experience often several times a week very 
      profound hallucinations.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      This should reveal to the practitioner of virtual techniques, that there 
      exist hallucinations which are <u>not</u> the byproduct of an insane or 
      damaged brain or psyche, but that the practitioner is indeed able to exercise 
      complete control over his creations. More about this point later on in this 
      article.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
      resume the above we must therefore say, that we can learn from the CBS paper, 
      that hallucinations, visualizations and imagination are possible for completely 
      sane people, respectively, that practicing of virtual techniques must not 
      lead automatically to insane states of the psyche, as sometimes claimed.</font></p>

      Why is it impossible to eradicate the belief in &quot;ghosts&quot; and "apparitions" 
      ?</font></h3>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
      very important aspect of the CBS-article is, that it elucidates very well, 
      why the belief in &quot;ghosts&quot; and "apparitions" is so widespread 
      throughout all cultures of humankind and why it's also documented in the 
      oldest texts and documents of ancient times.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      CBS as an entirely physiologically triggered phenomenon must have been present 
      within all nations of all times in man's history. It is therefore a principal 
      phenomenon wired into the human nature and was experienced spontaneously 
      by all people who met the <a href="CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html#criteria" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html#criteria" target="cbsecr1">criteria</a> 
      of the CBS (i.e., reduced visual ability, old age, etc., cf. the <a href="CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html#criteria" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html#criteria" target="cbsecr2">CBS-paper</a>).</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
      can suppose that the CBS is experienced even by animals with a highly developed 
      central nervous system and sense-inventory, e.g. birds and mammals (dog, 
      cat, horse, mouse, etc.) which are also able to dream.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      is obvious, that the phenomena triggered by the CBS (hallucinations of angels, 
      ghosts, beings, deceased people, translucent figures floating around, and 
      similar things) were then interpreted by people of rudimentary cultures 
      (formerly called &quot;primitive tribes&quot;) or by people with a &quot;magical&quot; 
      ideation according to their philosophical conceptions.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
      even an over-rationalistic, materialistic attitude cannot do anything about 
      the &quot;irrational clinging&quot; of people to such concepts must not 
      be explained, as it has been done until now, by the &quot;irrationality&quot; 
      of people, but by the <u>rationality</u> of the same, because these experiences 
      are perfectly valid as really existent perceptions.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 
      the strongest dogma cannot do anything about it, that a person experiences 
      dreams when asleep, because the ability to dream is wired deeply into the 
      biological nature of humans. A dogmatic rationalistic attitude must succumb 
      in the long run to the seemingly &quot;trivial belief&quot; in ghosts and 
      apparitions, because these experiences, when triggered by the CBS, are in 
      the same way a part of our human nature, as a hand or a foot is.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Note: 
      I'm not talking here about the problem, if &quot;entities&quot; like the 
      ones described in Bardon's PME do exist &quot;objectively&quot; or not; 
      this discussion must be postponed to later research.)</font></p>

    <h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">III.) 
      The Charles Bonnet Syndrome and the errors of the occultists.</font></h3>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
      it was outlined in <a href="#eradic">II</a>. to the rationalist, what he 
      can learn from the CBS.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore 
      it should be set out also to the occultist (as the natural opposite of the 
      rationalist) that he must also draw his conclusions from the CBS.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Teunisse's 
      work elucidates very well, that many phenomena which occultists rely to 
      a so called &quot;astral-&quot; or &quot;mental plane&quot; are solely creations 
      on its own of the human brain. A trivial occultist makes the trivial and 
      wrong assumption, that this kind of hallucination is the product of an objective 
      reality. Of course there is involved a lot of wishful thinking.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certainly 
      everyone who is lowering himself to such a laughable standard must expect 
      the strict condemnation by more intelligent people.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every 
      hypnotherapist knows very well, that he must put someone only into a light 
      trance to evoke every kind of &quot;entity&quot; or to create into the clients 
      mind every kind of experience or apparition he likes. Everyone who believes 
      that the &quot;two miniature policemen guiding a midget villain to a tiny 
      prison van&quot; (<a href="CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html#poli" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/CharlesBonnetSyndrome_e.html#poli" target="polie">here</a> 
      the original text) in Teunisse's article, exist objectively &quot;on another

    <h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IV.) 
      The CBS-article as a model of excellent research regarding special mental 
      abilities and phenomena.</font></h3>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      this section I would like to point out the significant difference between 
      the scientist's attitude or his working methods and the unsystematic or 
      even dubious ways of occultists.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      approach of occultists and esoteric people is more like that of a pioneer 
      and adventurer who jumps into a new and unknown territory and begins to 
      investigate this new domain just &quot;somehow&quot; in an unsystematic 
      and arbitrary way. As soon as he finds out or experiences a new phenomenon 
      he is fascinated about his new &quot;cognition&quot; and questions not at 
      all the meaning and relevance of these phenomena in regard to the overall 
      context of his experience. He takes his experiences as such as they present 
      themselves to him and thinks that they are in the same way valid for all 
      other people or that his new &quot;wisdom&quot; as applicable to the most 
      different domains and circumstances.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      jumps to conclusions which must not at all be generally valid or might be 
      even wrong. He is working completely on his own as an isolated individual 
      and doesn't compare his experiences with the ones of other pioneers investigating 
      the same area. The occultist relies always only on his <u>own</u> perspective 
      and his <u>own</u> experiences and never &quot;wastes&quot; his time to 
      investigate how they relate when compared with the findings of other people.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, 
      the employed methods are very often highly dubious or of an absolutely trivial 
      nature. Just think about the assessment of e.g. color meanings/relations 
      by the pendulum, or about the kabbalistic method of Gematra, where the cross-sum 
      of the numeric attributions of two words is supposed to prove something 
      objective about the relation of these two words. Another example is the 
      sort of &quot;wild&quot; exegesis (interpretation) of the Bible or other 
      standard texts as a common practice of esoteric people, not to speak about 
      the widespread practice of pseudoepigraphy (= to publish a book by the name 
      of a well known philosopher or mystic to heighten the prestige of these 
      writings) which is nothing other than fiction or in other words a plain 
      lie in the meanest and most condemnable sense of the word. Hundreds of examples 
      could be offered here and many very well known occultists would show up 
      in such a list (e.g.: Eliphas Levi, Robert Fludd, Khunrath, Bischoff, E.A. 
      Waite, J.W. v. Goethe [not really an occultist], and many others).</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
      a completely different attitude and nature and by far more solid is the 
      approach of the scientist. When he discovers a new phenomenon he begins 
      immediately to study and examine it in a very systematic way. He is not 
      satisfied just to be able to provoke the phenomenon at hand but tries to 
      uncover very carefully, methodically, meticulously and with immense patience 
      the precise connections, interactions, implications, differences and conditions 
      which are relevant to the phenomena. He is always very suspicious and tries 
      to find errors in his methods or explications, he looks for differences 
      which could point out that he's on the wrong track and he is always very 
      cautious in his judgment of how pertinent his explications are in regard 
      to the overall significance and relevance of the phenomena.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
      compares his findings with the studies of other scientists that are working 
      in the same or other areas and expects that his findings will get confirmed 
      or can be reproduced by his fellow researchers. Here begins a vivid exchange 
      of thoughts and views with the entire scientific community and the scientist 
      is always disposed (or at least he should be disposed) to change his mind 
      if there arise new findings or concepts. He knows very well that his opinions 
      represent always only <u>hypotheses</u> and <u>theories</u>, whereas occultists 
      often believe that they have found some kind of &quot;truth&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      outcome of such a substantial and solid attitude is, of course, an immensely 
      extended relevance and reliability of the scientists findings in regard 
      to the applicability and significance of the researched topic. This kind 
      of thoroughness ultimately pays off and is the main reason for the tremendous 
      success of modern science. A success which could be obtained also by occultists 
      if they were willing to improve their methods.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
      give a practical example we could inspect Teunisse's work in regard to the 
      optical clarity of visual hallucinations.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 
      occultist could for example find out, that his &quot;inner vision&quot; 
      becomes after some training by far more acute than his perception of real 
      existent, outside objects. Typically he would write in a publication with 
      pompous and mystifying formulations, how superior the &quot;inner vision&quot; 
      is. He would speak just for himself because he has never tested any other

      of other people, in other circumstances and what the outcome with different

      The CBS-article proves in a very impressive way that the brain of completely 
      sane people is able to produce virtual pictures (hallucinations) in the 
      <u>wakeful-/everyday consciousness</u> with such a degree of clarity, that 
      there is not left the least difference between these virtual pictures and 
      the pictures produced by really existent objects, or that the clarity and 
      acuity of these virtual pictures even surpass real objects: 45% (it's almost 
      one half) of all clients studied in Teunisse's article experienced hallucinations 
      that were clearer than real objects; cf. this section in the CBS article.</font></p>

      And exactly this ability we learn in Step Three of Bardon's system.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
      is very important !</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Very 
      often the degree of ability that Bardon is requiring here is severely underestimated. 
      Most often people content themselves with the visualization of ordinary 
      pictures. But it is of vital importance that one must be able to produce 
      with open eyes virtual spatial pictures in a way that there remains not 
      the least difference between this created visual spatial object and a real 
      objective object. (The term &quot;picture&quot; is often misleading because 
      it connotes for most people only a two dimensional, flat image.) </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore 
      one must be able to put for example a visualized, 3-dimensional spatial 
      orange next to a real, objective orange and there must not be any difference 
      between the two in regard to clarity, color, shape, shade, depth of focus, 
      and so on.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
      very important and most often overlooked point is that the practitioner 
      must also be able to do this in his <u>wakeful/everyday</u> state of consciousness; 
      in other words: by no means should there arise a trance, not even a light 
      one, (autohypnotic state), which makes this kind of hallucinatory production 
      of virtual objects a lot easier.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
      one tests the ability of a number of practitioners in this regard one will 
      find in most cases, that this degree of mastery is accomplished very seldom. 
      Most often it is found that only very poor abilities become apparent and 
      that the more versatile practitioners get into a, at least light, but most 
      often even deep state of partial trance, when they try to produce this phenomenon. 
      <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
      person born with this kind of ability was the great scientist and inventor 
      <b>Nicolai Tesla</b>.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      so often with such abilities, which we regard as highly welcome, when they 
      manifest spontaneously, they are sometimes very troublesome. With Tesla 
      these pictures were so intense that he spoke even of an &quot;ailment&quot; 
      which bothered him in his youth.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      a boy, Tesla was tormented by flashing lights and images of remembered scenes 
      that would appear before his eyes without warning and with blinding intensity. 
      A single word spoken to Tesla in conversation might suddenly trigger a lifelike 
      image of the person or thing that the word represented. These images were 
      so real that Tesla found himself &quot;quite unable to distinguish whether 
      what I saw was tangible or not&quot; a confusion which caused him &quot;great 
      discomfort and anxiety&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
      exactly this ability we acquire in Step Three of Bardon's system.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore 
      I'm calling Bardon's Step Three in my private terminology the &quot;<u><b>Tesla-level</b></u>&quot;. 
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
      this terminology is very impressive but meets only a part of the truth is 
      realized at once when we understand, that the term &quot;Tesla-level&quot; 
      addresses only one sense modality, namely the visual one.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      Step Three we must master the same ability also with all other sense modalities. 
      Especially in the auditive sense modality.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      We could name therefore Bardon's Step Three (IIH) also the &quot;Beethoven&quot; 
      or the &quot;Mozart&quot; level, because those two composers were blessed 
      exactly with this ability to create &quot;inner&quot; sounds (music) with 
      a degree of clarity, that was comparable to that of physically produced 
      (instruments, speaker, etc.) sounds. Probably also in this sense modality 
      the virtual sound production might exceed the quality of physically produced 
      sounds, even if we have no scientifically proved data regarding it to date.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Very interesting in this regard is the fate of Beethoven, who developed 
      just deafness in his later life-period, what for any &quot;ordinary&quot; 
      composer would mark the end of his career.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not 
      so for Beethoven because he could make use of his virtual soundspace which 
      we also achieve by practicing the Bardon Step Tree exercises; therefore 
      Beethoven was able to continue with his composing of marvelous symphonies, 
      even as a completely deaf person. Mozart surpassed even this degree of skill 
      because he wrote in his diaries, that he was able to experience an <u>entire</u> 
      composition simultaneously in a kind of &quot;spatial-sound like&quot; structure, 
      in way we experience a physical object in one instant visually as a complete 
      structure.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
      what point these abilities of virtual constructing with all our sense modalities 
      (virtual reality) will lead us and how far-reaching these abilities are, 
      we aren't even able to glimpse at present.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
      we could name Bardons Step Three also the Tesla-Beethoven or the Tesla-Mozart 
      level. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
      I'm very adamant with this terminology, because these abilities lay the 
      foundation for the auditive and/or visual genius such as Beethoven and Tesla.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 
      the way I should mention that Tesla (as well as Professor Ludwig Staudenmaier 
      and many others) tried his entire life to ban his vivid images onto a photographic 
      film. This is a further indication how clear and intensive his images must 
      have been. Though even the great Tesla was not blessed with success, it 
      is very improbable that we will have more success with it in the near future.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
      this ability is not only a gain but can become also very dangerous when 
      it gets out of control you can guess from the example of Schizophrenia and 
      craziness. You can find also many examples of the dangerous nature of it 
      everywhere in the scientific literature.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
      know personally about the case of a student at the local high school who 
      was able, by reading any text only once, to reproduce it as a mental picture 
      before his &quot;mental eye&quot; exactly as it was written. It happened 
      that before one test, for which he had done no preparatory homework, he 
      was able to read hastily in part the relevant text in the textbook immediately 
      before the teacher entered the classroom. During the test he was able to 
      reproduce the text exactly till to the point where he had to stop reading 
      when the teacher entered the classroom. You see, such abilities are not 
      so rare as you might think. To point out the danger of the ability involved 
      you should know, that this student became crazy some years later on and 
      finished in the lunatic asylum, probably because he was not able to get 
      control over his very vivid mental images.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
      again we can see, how ingenious Bardon's system is. The banning of images, 
      sounds and other components of our thinking process is learned (in Step 
      One) <u>before</u> one learns to create such intense virtual pictures, sounds 
      and feelings, so that the student is prepared for the further skills.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No 
      wonder that even Tesla spoke about an &quot;ailment&quot;. Imagine to get 
      bombarded all the time with flashing pictures or noisy sounds throughout 
      the day. Tesla eventually overcame this &quot;affliction&quot; through mental 
      exercise and sheer willpower.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
      we should speak about the applications of Tesla's abilities. Those are unbelievably 
      manifold and of a so far-reaching importance that we are not in the least 
      able to evaluate them at present.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="tesmachine"></a>Tesla 
      possessed the remarkable ability to visualize his inventions in minute detail 
      before even beginning to write them down. He would mentally build a new 
      device part by part and test-run it, all in his imagination. So accurate 
      were Tesla's mental blueprints that he could diagnose a problem with a machine 
      by the way it ran in his mind.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Tesla wrote: &quot;It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine 
      in thought or test it in my shop, I even note if it is out of balance. There 
      is no difference whatever, the results were the same.&quot; </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
      is exactly the point which is important to me.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
      this reason I believe, that Bardon's system could serve as a <u>training 
      program</u> for the <u>entire humanity</u>. Imagine a world where everyone 
      has at his disposal this very ability (and many others pertaining to the 
      other sense modalities) <b>! ! !</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
      we are speaking here only about the Tesla-level, Bardon's Step Three ...<br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      same of course holds true for all other sense modalities.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
      the importance of these abilities are in the domain of all areas of the 
      &quot;ordinary, everyday life&quot; becomes apparent by the example of Tesla's 
      abilities. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everyone 
      gifted with a little bit of fantasy will realize immediately, how strong 
      the impact on the evolution of humankind would be. Think about technology, 
      architecture, etc., etc.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 
      Bardon speaks about it when he says in Step Three: &quot;Those students 
      who are willing to make the necessary effort will be greatly satisfied with 
      the powers they acquire through these concentration exercises.&quot; And: 
      &quot;The concentration exercises of this step not only strengthen the willpower 
      and the ability of concentration, but all our intellectual and mental powers.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every 
      person with such abilities will be highly welcomed in every domain of all 
      human activities and he will never be in the need to get undue advantages 
      over his fellow men by &quot;occult&quot; means.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
      Such a person will be a highly respected and most valuable part of the human 
      society, he will create unbelievable treasures for our culture and foster 
      the progress of humankind as a whole.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
      course many readers of this article will remain skeptical, if the here described 
      abilities are really in reach of everyone of us.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
      is naturally not sufficient to create an Utopian like concept, but one must 
      also make sure, that the realization of such a one gets accomplished in 
      the real world.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
      this aspect of the practical realization I will pay attention in my next, 
      more practical oriented article, where I will try to prove that this admittedly 
      high degree of mastery is indeed in the reaches of every ordinary person.</font></p>
