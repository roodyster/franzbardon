III</a>
<p>Visualization difficulties are a common problem for a part of newcomers
when they begin to practice Bardon's system.
<p>To illustrate this please read a posting to the old Franz Bardon Bulletin
at: <font color="#330033"><a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/fb_archiv.html'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/fb_archiv.html#26-2-98'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/fb_archiv.html#26-2-98">FBB

<p>I worked with a small number of beginners having this problem and it
was found, that a special preparatory exercise seems to bring quick results.
<p>As explained before, if someone with poor visualization skills closes
his eyes trying to visualize something, he will experience serious difficulties.
Such a person will see nothing at all with her/his inner eyes and therefore
has nothing to concentrate upon. In most cases such a person will enter
the process of looking at a chosen item, closing the eyes and trying to
visualize it (without success), opening the eyes after a few moments again
and repeating the process for many times.
<br>&nbsp;This is an fact a very frustrating process and most people will
give up this kind of concentration drill after a few weeks of non rewarding
efforts even when they are highly motivated to persevere. So a certain
percentage of potential hermetic magicians drop away and only persons with
natural good visualization skills will move on with the system.
<p>Now it was found, that for poor visualizers it works better to directly
stimulate the visual cortex, and not to try to visualize anything at all
at first. Direct stimulation of the visual cortex is best accomplished
by to methods:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<b>The inverse color method (= the flashing tablets method,&nbsp; = the
candle flame method).</b></li>

<li>
<b>"Looking at ordinary things"-method.</b></li>
</ol>

<p><br>Both methods are very well documented in the occult literature.
<p><b><font size=+1>1. The inverse colors method.</font></b>
<p>Use a flashing tablet or diagram like&nbsp;<a href="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/drei.html'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/drei.html'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/drei.html"><img SRC="drei_k.jpg" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/drei_k.jpg" height=40 width=40></a>
(klick on the symbol to get the hole picture).
<br>Now look attentively at it for 2-3 minutes. Try to exclude all thoughts
(shut down the inner dialog). After looking for some time at the tablet
look at a white paper sheet or at an empty space on the wall and fixate
for as long as possible the appearing inverse color picture. Don't try
to visualize anything at all. You will notice that the picture hides and
reappears in a regular pattern and at last fades out after some time. Alternatively
you can also look at the inverse color picture with your eyes closed. But
it was found that the colors are more brilliant with your eyes open. You
will also notice, that brightness and color of the inverse color picture
will change with changes in the light source and background.
<br>Do this exercise two times a day for about 10 minutes. Always quit
when you feel your eyes begin to get tired.
<br>(You can use also the candle flame method, but it works not as good
as the former method: Fixate in a dark room for some time the flame of
an ordinary candle, close your eyes and look at the appearing colors as
explained above.)
<p><font size=+1>2. The "Looking at ordinary things"-method.</font>
<p>It's better to use first the "Inverse color method" and after having
practiced it for a while to add this one.
<br>Look intently for 2-3 minutes at an ordinary item. It should be not
to big and not to small. (It should be of about the same size as the flashing
tablet which you used before.) Again move your eyes away and look on an
empty space on the wall. If there appears spontaneously a picture of the
physical object (NO INVERSE COLORS !) on which you looked at, fine, if
not, don't try to visualize anything. Just look again for 2-3 minutes at
the physical object. After some time there will begin to appear on the
wall or "in the air " in your minds eye a copy of the physical picture.
First only for a glimpse then for a always longer time. Look at this picture
as long as possible, but don't try to expand the time. Simply turn back
to the physical object when the visualized picture vanishes.
<br>Now and then check if you can visualize the physical object also with
your eyes closed. If you are able to do so for 5 - 15 seconds, go on with
the visualization exercises as explained by Bardon.
