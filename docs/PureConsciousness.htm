<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While most accounts 
  of &quot;awareness&quot; during sleep have focused on the phenomenon of &quot;dream 
  lucidity,&quot; in this presentation I will discuss a qualitatively distinct 
  state of consciousness beyond ordinary lucidity that can be experienced along 
  with dreaming and deep sleep. This state is referred to in the ancient Vedic 
  tradition as samadhi or &quot;pure consciousness.&quot; When this state is maintained 
  during dreaming or sleep, it is said to serve as a silent &quot;witness&quot; 
  or observer to these changing relative states.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Distinguishing 
  Between Pure Consciousness and Dream Lucidity</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us begin by 
  distinguishing between ordinary lucidity and witnessing. Dream lucidity appears 
  to involve a commingling of the ordinary waking state with the dream state. 
  During the process of dreaming, it is as if the cognitive capacities of the 
  ordinary waking state become activated, and one can now function volitionally 
  from within the dream world. One&#146;s awareness typically remains identified 
  (or associated) with that of the dream ego, but an arsenal of additional waking 
  state abilities are added (e.g., rational decision processes, memory of having 
  been awake). In lucid dreaming, though one can now actively think about the 
  fact that one is dreaming, one still remains relatively absorbed in the dream 
  world.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast, the 
  experience of pure consciousness is said to totally transcend the activities 
  of both ordinary waking and sleeping. Whereas dream lucidity is typically associated 
  with an increase in cognitive processing and possibly somatic arousal, pure 
  consciousness is described as a heightened state of content-free awareness accompanied 
  by deep silence, a state in which all ordinary activity of thinking, feeling 
  and perceiving has come to a complete rest, yet awareness remains wide awake 
  within itself. What wakes up in lucid dreaming is the localized, active individual 
  ego of the ordinary waking state, the bounded &quot;I&quot; of experience with 
  which we typically identify&#151;albeit now transported into a dream landscape. 
  In contrast, what wakes up during witnessing is the silent, unified state of 
  pure consciousness, said to lie at the basis of all active states of mind and 
  changing states of consciousness. In this state, awareness becomes fully &quot;self-referral,&quot; 
  capable of knowing itself directly without conceptual mediation of any kind. 
  The boundaries of the active, localized self are transcended and awareness is 
  said to become identified with a silent inner unbounded Self at the origin of 
  mind, which is experienced as &quot;I-ness,&quot; &quot;amness of &quot;Being.&quot; 
  Maharishi describes this experience of the Self:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Self has two 
    connotations: lower self and higher Self. The lower self is that aspect of 
    the personality that deals only with the relative aspect of existence. It 
    comprises the mind that thinks, the intellect that decides, the ego that experiences. 
    This lower self functions only in the relative states of existence&#151;waking, 
    dreaming, and deep sleep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The higher Self is that aspect 
    of the personality which never changes, absolute Being [pure consciousness], 
    which is the very basis of the entire field of relativity, including the lower 
    self.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In &quot;witnessing,&quot; 
  the Self becomes fully differentiated from and an observer to the changing states 
  of waking, dreaming and sleep and the functioning of the localized self which 
  is embedded in those states. Thus, unlike the typical lucid state in which the 
  localized waking-state self can now function from within the dream, in witnessing, 
  an unbounded Self silently observes from outside of the dream state.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Maharishi&#146;s 
  Vedic tradition, witnessing can become a constant reality experienced throughout 
  the 24-hour waking/sleeping cycle and not just experienced during rare moments 
  while dreaming. The goal of Transcendental Meditation (TM) is to provide systematic 
  experience of the pure consciousness state. Maharishi explains:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Transcendental 
    Meditation technique is an effortless procedure for allowing the excitation 
    of the mind to gradually settle down until the least excited state of mind 
    is reached. This is a state of inner wakefulness with no object or thought 
    or perception, just pure consciousness, aware of its own unbounded nature. 
    It is wholeness, aware of itself, devoid of difference, beyond the division 
    of subject and object&#151;transcendental consciousness.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During this experience 
  knower, known, and the process of knowing converge in one wholeness of experience. 
  This is described as a self-referral state. Because there is only the awareness 
  of awareness. You are aware that you are. There is no active processing of mental 
  contents; it is just a state of pure &quot;knowing-ness,&quot; or being. It 
  is a very gratifying kind of existential reconnection with your basic self.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of meditation, 
  of the TM program, is to maintain this pure consciousness state outside of meditation. 
  On the basis of the deep state of rest experienced during TM, tension and stress 
  is released that otherwise blocks one from this silent experience of the Self. 
  Gradually, over years of meditating, this pure consciousness begins to adhere 
  to you, or you adhere to it, and you begin to maintain this silent state during 
  waking, dreaming, and sleeping. Pure consciousness then functions as a witness 
  to ordinary daily activity. You still may engage in ordinary thought, but the 
  silent state is as a backdrop to active states of consciousness. The advantage 
  of this silent state is that it is a state of complete harmony, peace, and inner 
  fulfillment, and cannot be disrupted. Because it doesn&#146;t get disrupted, 
  you don&#146;t lose this &quot;inner lifeline&quot; to Being within.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A substantial body 
  of research has been conducted on the psychophysiological correlates of pure 
  consciousness. Maharishi predicted that pure consciousness would prove to be 
  a distinctive state of restful alertness qualitatively different from ordinary 
  waking, dreaming and sleeping. On the one hand, a deep state of inner silence 
  would be experienced. On the other hand, one is said to become increasingly 
  alert or aware. Indeed, enlightenment is sometimes referred to as simply being 
  fully awake. Thus, this state is said to have a dual character of being both 
  very silent yet more awake, but not aroused. It is both together in one condition.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has now been 
  repeatedly shown that in the experience of pure consciousness during TM (as 
  indicated by button pressing immediately after the experience) respiration rate 
  often drops to virtually zero for as long as a few seconds up to minute. For 
  some advanced practitioners of TM, their respiration is virtually absent for 
  over half of their meditation. On the other hand, during these experiences, 
  EEG alpha and theta power increased substantially. Also, EEG patterns became 
  more &quot;coherent&quot;&#151;i.e., brain waves (especially in the frontal 
  and central regions), thus suggesting a simultaneous increase in alertness and 
  functional integration.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that I have 
  conceptually described the pure consciousness state and how it may differ from 
  lucidity, let me provide some phenomenological descriptions of this state. I&#146;ll 
  begin with experiences of pure consciousness in isolation during experiences 
  of TM, as reported by subjects. Their reports are bolstered by the fact that 
  they also displayed substantial periods of respiratory suspension and increased 
  EEG coherence associated with these experiences. The first subject says,</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I experience 
    pure consciousness, it is a state in which I am awake and aware, but not aware 
    of anything except awareness itself. As I merge into the experience, outer-relatedness 
    lessens and inner peace and self-sufficiency remains. It is not an intellectual 
    experience. It is by far the most intimate and simple experience in my life.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A second experience:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I experience 
    pure consciousness as a state of unboundedness and total ease and deep relaxation. 
    There are no thoughts, no feelings, or any other sensations like weight or 
    temperature. I just know I am. There is no notion of time or space, but my 
    mind is fully awake and perfectly clear. It is a very simple and natural state.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This quote clarifies 
  that this is &quot;pure&quot; in that it is content-free. There is no object 
  of thought. It is not qualified by any particular thought or feeling. It is 
  awareness awake to its own nature, but without any content. That is why the 
  experience has been described as &quot;being&quot; or just &quot;am-ness.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These experiences, 
  of course, don&#146;t just take place in meditators, they occur in non-meditators 
  as well. The purpose of meditation is to stimulate more frequent occurrence 
  of this experience. In &quot;Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&quot; 
  written by the nineteenth-century poet Wordsworth (1904 edition), a spontaneous 
  experience of pure consciousness seemed to be described:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
    &#151;that serene and blessed mood,</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In which the 
    affections gently lead us on,&#151;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Until the breath 
    of this corporeal frame</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And even the 
    motion of our human blood</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost suspended, 
    we are laid asleep</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In body, and 
    become a living soul:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This poem clearly 
  describes the dual character of pure consciousness. He describes this experience 
  of attention spontaneously settling down as it does during meditation, until 
  the breath becomes &quot;almost suspended.&quot; Yet at the same time we &quot;become 
  a living soul.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have begun to 
  conduct research to determine if pure consciousness can be maintained outside 
  of meditation&#151;especially during sleep. In a pilot study of an advanced 
  TM meditator who claimed to be having this witnessing experience of a serene 
  inner state throughout waking, dreaming, and sleeping, we found when compared 
  to the sleep of two lucid dreamers and a non-lucid dreamer, that this particular 
  subject seemed to physiologically maintain a deeper state of rest. He had lower 
  respiration rate, lower heart rate, and less REM density, but he also appeared 
  to be alert and could signal from REM sleep, Stage I, and Stage II sleep with 
  strong lateral eye movements. This suggests that he may be experiencing the 
  restfully alert state of pure consciousness during sleep.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through the efforts 
  of Jayne Gackenbach and Robert Cranson we also now have some preliminary content 
  analyses of the pure conscious experience during sleep. A very advanced group 
  of meditators at an in-residence meditation facility in upstate New York filled 
  out questionnaires on their frequency of experiencing three types of consciousness 
  in sleep: lucid dreaming (which we defined as actively thinking about the fact 
  that you are dreaming); witnessing dreaming (while dreaming you experience a 
  quiet, peaceful inner awareness or wakefulness completely separate from the 
  dream); or witnessing deep sleep (during dreamless sleep you experience a quiet, 
  peaceful, inner state of awareness of wakefulness). These subjects were then 
  required for validation purposes to provide a detailed description of these 
  experiences. Gackenbach then performed a content analysis by first identifying 
  categories that may discriminate among these experiences and then assigning 
  the different experiences into each category. There were 55 lucid dreams, 41 
  witnessing dreams, and 47 witnessing in deep sleep experiences reported by these 
  66 advanced male meditators. The content categories showing distinctions between 
  them are depicted in Table 1.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most revealing 
  of these categories was the one on feelings of separateness. In lucid dreaming 
  only 7 percent of the cases were those in which people reported feeling separateness. 
  In the witnessing dream experience, 73 percent of the cases spontaneously reported 
  in their dream description that the dream went on, but they were separate from 
  it. These reports are consistent with our conceptual descriptions of witnessing 
  as involving the complete differentiation of pure consciousness from the dream 
  state&#151;functions as a silent witness completely distinct from or outside 
  of the dreaming state.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following are examples 
  of maintaining the silent experience of pure consciousness along with but separate 
  from the dream state: &quot;Sometimes no matter what comes into the dream, I 
  feel an inner tranquil awareness that is removed from the dreaming. Sometimes 
  I may even be caught up in the dream but the inner awareness of peace remains.&quot; 
  Another example: &quot;I watch it as it is going on separate from me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
  There are parts, me and the dream, two different realities.&quot; These are 
  examples of this feeling of separateness.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another category 
  which is interesting is that of emotion. There seem to be positive emotions 
  associated with all three states, but extremely positive emotion was reported 
  more frequently for witnessing dreaming and witnessing deep sleep as were feelings 
  of lightness. This is reminiscent of, according to Maharishi&#146;s Vedic tradition, 
  an experience of profound bliss or ananda experience of the inner Self or Being.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
  dream control was much more frequent during lucid dreaming than witnessing dreams. 
  This is consistent with the claims that dream lucidity typically involves active 
  information processes, manipulation of dream content. As it were, the &quot;will&quot; 
  or volitional capacity of the individual ego can act on its thoughts and desires. 
  This is in contrast to the experience of pure consciousness which is said to 
  be one of complete inner fulfillment or contentment. The Self does not act, 
  but silently observes the changes occurring within waking, dreaming, and sleep.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also over half 
  the time lucid dreaming was triggered by incongruent mental events in the dreams 
  that appeared to stimulate or awaken intellectual or discriminative processes 
  typical of the waking state. On the other hand, witnessing dreaming and sleep 
  were virtually never triggered by such mental events. The most unambiguous criterion 
  of witnessing is maintenance of pure consciousness even during deep sleep. Because 
  lucidity involves active thinking and deep sleep is generally, although not 
  always, without mentation, it is not surprising that lucidity (as typically 
  experienced) drops out during deep sleep. However, after long-term practice, 
  TM practitioners gradually begin to report experiences of &quot;witnessing,&quot; 
  or maintenance of pure consciousness, even during dreamless sleep.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are a few 
  examples:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a feeling 
    of infinite expansion and bliss and nothing else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. First, 
    it is like an abstract experience of bliss. There is no identity at all. Then 
    I become aware that I exist, but there is no individual personality. Then 
    I become aware that I am an individual, but no details of who, where, or what 
    or when. Eventually these details fill in, and I might then wake up. Sometimes 
    I&#146;m lying there very quietly enjoying the silence, and then I will gradually 
    become aware that I am snoring.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another experience:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you describe 
    an unmanifest experience? It has only happened a half dozen times in 15 years, 
    but when it occurs, it&#146;s crystal clear. Silence, wakefulness. Dark/clear 
    and open. Silent/lively&#151;like an amplifier turned on, but no sound. The 
    experience fades as boundaries of dreams or waking state gather, gain definition 
    and overshadow.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the perspective 
  of Maharishi&#146;s Vedic Science, the significance of the experience of pure 
  consciousness is that it provides the foundation for the development of stable 
  higher stages of consciousness or &quot;enlightenment.&quot; Witnessing of deep 
  sleep indicates that the inner wakefulness of pure consciousness is now beginning 
  to be maintained even during the most extreme conditions of mental inertia&#151;dreamless 
  sleep. Indeed, according to Maharishi, the first stable higher stage of consciousness, 
  termed &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot;&#151;is defined as the maintenance of 
  pure consciousness throughout the 24-hour cycle of waking, dreaming, and deep 
  sleep.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One final consideration, 
  in the growth of the first stage of enlightenment, pure consciousness is said 
  to become a silent observer or witness to the changing states of waking, dreaming, 
  and sleeping. However, this development of inner self-sufficiency should not 
  be confused with a state of compassionless detachment. In accordance with Erik 
  Erikson&#146;s injunction that identity provides the basis of intimacy, it is 
  also when one establishes one&#146;s ultimate inner identity, &quot;Being&quot; 
  or Self that a truly profound foundation for intimacy with others is achieved. 
  Unless you fully know who you are through the self-referral of Being, you are 
  not in an ideal position to know and help others. The unbounded Self is classically 
  described as &quot;nonattached&quot; not because it is withdrawn but because 
  it can no longer be disrupted or overshadowed by the boundaries or changing 
  values of thoughts, perceptions and actions. The blissful experience of inner 
  Being thus provides a natural basis for sharing. The sharing of one&#146;s happiness 
  and inner resources with others.</font></p>
