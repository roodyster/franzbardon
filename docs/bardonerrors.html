      <h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="hem"></a>The 

        errors contained in &quot;The Practice of magical Evokation&quot;</font></h3>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

        errors that are best known are the ones contained in Bardons 2nd book, 

        &quot;The Practice of magical Evocation&quot;.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 

        were published already elsewhere in a number of sources, nevertheless 

        I want to summarize them also here. The following comes most probably 

        out of <a href="hemberge.html" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/hemberge.html" target="hem">Hembergers</a> 

        work.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

        so called beings of the sphere of Jupiter are &quot;in reality&quot; spirits 

        of the Saturn sphere. Bardon used here as source Quintschers Kabbalit. 

        An indication are the signs of Saturn and the rings of Saturn all over 

        the diagrams of the &quot;Jupiter-entities&quot; in PME. As final proof 

        you must compare Bardons PME and Qintschers Kabbalit.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 

        to Quintschers Kabbalit there exist not 15 Saturn Genii as Bardon claims, 

        but only 12. The same source indicates, that in Bardons PME are missing 

        all contrary beings (negative spirits), for example the 12 negative spirits 

        of the Saturn, or the 72 negative spirits of the Shemhamphorash (Bardons 

        mercury spirits) as given by Hercumius. If this is really an error is 

        disputable; probably Bardon intentionally did not add the negative counter-spirits, 

        what he states plainly in his PME (see note between 65 &quot;Dosom&quot; 

        u. 66 &quot;Galago&quot;, 360-EZS).</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Because 

        of Bardons confounding the Jupiter with the Saturn spirits there are missing 

        all &quot;real&quot; Jupiter genii; furthermore one must, according to 

        the same source, be in possession also of the Mars-spirits that are missing 

        in Bardon PME; they can be found in the Piccatrix.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon 

        used also a number of Quintschers &quot;earth zone&quot;-spirits and by 

        doing so he made some mistakes, the author of that source insists. It 

        is also possible, that Bardon made some improvements or adjustments. Anyway: 

        the colors in the diagram of Sata-Pessajah are wrong and Bardon forgot 

        to add, that it is a entity of the Sirius. Instead of &quot;Nablum&quot; 

        (1&deg; cancer) one must use the name &quot;Nabhi&quot;, the diagram shown 

        in PME is not the right one. Eliphas Levi gives the right spelling for 

        the 11. spirit of the Shemhamphorash (Bardons Mercury spirits). It must 

        be &quot;Lauviah&quot; and not &quot;Leviviah&quot;. Furthermore Morechs 

        diagram is wrong, the true one is contained in Quintschers work.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hemberger 
        (Dr. Klingsor) affirms in his book &quot;<a href="hemberge.html" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/hemberge.html" target="em">Experimental-Magie</a>&quot; 
        (page 242 f), that an entity and his negative counterpart (the evil spirit) 
        are associated like the two poles of a magnet, and that without the knowledge 
        of the negative counterpart no true evocation is possible. Bardons PME 
        is therefore practically useless. Hemberger states further, that this 
        fact has been confirmed by the Fraternity of Saturn through systematic 
        experiments. My personal opinion is, that I don't think, that any member 
        of the Fraternity of Saturn was capable of the abilities as required in 
        IIH, especially the more advanced ones. I think, that it's indeed possible 
        to work only with the positive spirits, if one has good abilities. Otherwise 
        all Hebrew kabbalistic mystics had to work also with the spirit/counter-spirit, 
        a concept for which one cannot find any proof in the original kabbalistic 
        texts from the Renaissance. (But one can prove of course the contrary, 
        that Hebrew mystics used to a large extend only the positive angels, discarding 
        the negative ones.)</font></p>

      <h3 align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Errors, 

        discrepancies and criticism according to Paul Allen.</font></h3>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

        the years of studying Bardons system I did notice a number of quite serious 

        mistakes and/or misconceptions in Bardons work, which I will summarize 

        here briefly.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bardon 

        took the 360 &quot;spirits girdling the earth&quot; completely arbitrarily 

        out from his source, the Abramelin (<a href="stejnar.html#hammer" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/stejnar.html#hammer" target="hammer">Hammer 

        edition 1725</a>). If there had been exactly 360 spirits in Abramelins 

        list, then one could reckon, that Abramelin just wrote down his list with 

        the wrong epithet &quot;demon&quot; for his spirits, an error corrected 

        later by Bardon. If we should follow this line of argumentation, is not 

        sure. Because Abramelin states PLAINLY, that all spirits are just servants 

        of the chief-demons like Satan, Lucifer and so on. Bardon can therefore 

        be accused, that his second book is on demonology.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 

        it's not the case, that Abramelins list contains only 360 names. There 

        are more than 360 entries, and therefore some names on the list didn't 

        fit into Bardons concept of 360 equally distributed spirits &quot;around&quot; 

        the earth-zone. (One spirit name [<a href="stejnar.html#Faturab" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/stejnar.html#Faturab" target="fatur">Faturab</a>] 

        in the middle of the list has been overlooked by Bardon.) Here we must 

        definitely speak of arbitrariness. This arbitrariness has been taken even 

        one step further, because Bardon uses some of the names at the end of 

        Abramelins list for his names of the <a href="other2.htm#air" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/other2#air" target="air">spirits 

        of the element of air</a>. Now this is just to much. Here we can't be 

        lenient anymore! Of course, those students of Bardon who cannot stand 

        any criticism about their Magus-Guru will find a legitimization also in 

        this case. (Humans are always very inventive and creative when it comes 

        to find pretenses to justify something. E.g.: &quot;The earth has the 

        shape of a disc&quot;; why ? After all a sphere is nothing other than 

        a &quot;thick&quot; disc expanded on all sides and the sides bent &quot;down&quot; 

        a &quot;bit&quot; until all sides touch each other everywhere. If in the 

        center remains a hole you must only make your initial disk a bit &quot;thicker&quot;. 

        <u>The earth is a disk</u>: Quod erat demonstrandum.)</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 

        very dubious concept of Bardons system are the so called &quot;quantity 

        keys&quot; of the 72 Schemhamphorash genii (Bardons Mercury spirits), 

        that Bardon adopted from Athanasius Kirchers &quot;<a href="other.html#keys" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/other.html#keys" target="kir">Oedipus 

        aegyptiacus</a>&quot;.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

        </font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

        the time of Athanasius Kircher it was commonly accepted that the world 

        (in the shape of a disk) must be divided into 72 regions with 72 tribes, 

        following the Aristotelian concept of the perfect symmetry and order of 

        creation. As &quot;world&quot; they thought only of our earth, which they 

        believed to rest in the center of creation. The planets like Saturn Mars 

        etc. were called &quot;wandering stars&quot;, they didn't know, that those 

        are planets like our earth. The suns, which we name &quot;stars&quot; 

        today, were called &quot;fixed stars&quot;, because they thought that 

        these &quot;lights&quot; are solidly fixed onto the &quot;canopy&quot; 

        of heaven. </font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

        Because everything was ordered symmetrically, they thought that the earth 

        can be divided into 72 regions, with 72 tribes and languages, which have 

        different names of God, always composed from 4 letters, as Kircher tried 

        to convince his readers. This system worked fine for a number of widely 

        used names of God (because the languages had often a common root), for 

        example: Deus (Latin), Zeus (Greek), [Jupiter (Roman) was discarded as 

        not fitting into Kirchers rigid system], Gott (German) and so on. Kircher 

        tried to press all names of God for ever &quot;tribe on earth&quot; into 

        this arbitrary system.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 

        he was quite &quot;creative&quot; in some cases, you can see if you check 

        the <a href="other.html#ak1" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/other.html#ak1" target="qk">diagram</a> 

        yourself. Everyone familiar with Kirchers opus knows very well, that Kircher, 

        as the highest authority on Egyptian hieroglyphs of his time, gave to 

        the hieroglyphs a, as he said, &quot;inspiratively&quot; received but 

        in reality completely invented explanation of the meaning of the hieroglyphs, 

        and that he translated Egyptian texts this way in a completely wrong manner, 

        what became apparent centuries later, when the &quot;Rosetta stone&quot; 

        was found and the correct translation of Egyptian Texts became possible. 

        In the same dogmatic way Kircher fooled around with the different names 

        of God, adding, and subtracting letters as he liked.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 

        then comes Bardon and takes this complete obsolete system of Kirchers 

        four-lettered names of God, only because it fits well into his system 

        of the four-lettered kabbalistic key in relation to the 72 spirits of 

        the Mercury sphere.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 

        is in my opinion highly dubious and complete nonsense</font>.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 

        we are coming to some &quot;minor&quot; errors of Franz Bardon.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People 

        on the planet of Venus: normally it is excused in that Bardon meant the 

        &quot;astral&quot; plane and not the planet of Venus.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inspiration 

        = oxygen, expiration = nitrogen. In the theory part of IIH. The assimilation 

        process in the human body and the expiration of carbon dioxide was very 

        well known even at the time of Franz Bardon. The amount of nitrogen in 

        the inspired/expired air remains the same.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(All 

        people, who rely on Frabato as a true source for Bardons biography should 

        think a moment about the scene in Frabato where a friend of Bardon, after 

        a heavy rainfall, is very envious, because Bardon knows everything about 

        every field of knowledge on earth ... )</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Especially 

        disturbing I found always: the conscious part of our mind as being located 

        in the cortex, the subconscious in the cerebellum. Bardon: &quot;... the 

        seat of the normal consciousness, which is located in the cerebrum, and 

        the subconscious, the opposite of normal consciousness, which is located 

        in the cerebellum.&quot; (Introduction IIH, new Merkur edition.)</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such 

        a nonsense is really disgusting. I won't go into the details here, if 

        you don't understand, please check out the relevant textbooks. That Bardon 

        thinks of the conscious part of our mind as the opposite of the subconscious 

        is an addition to the infantile conception of the conscious/subconscious 

        relation. And that with more than 50 years after the publication of Freuds 

        &quot;Traumdeutung&quot;, and the almost enzyclopedic amount of C.G. Jungs 

        publications. I can't really understand how someone could write such things 

        in the fifties of the 20th century. </font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

        the first step of IIH Bardon explains, that when one uses autosuggestion, 

        only positive sentences must be used. But in his examples of this principle 

        he makes himself the error to formulate negatively.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 

        the reversal of character attributes to the elements of water and earth 

        are really an error, as <a href="stejnar.html" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/franzbardon/stejnar.html" target="stej">Stejnar</a> 

        points out, is not yet sure. Some astrologers use the same system as Bardon 

        in his first book (but most don't).</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 

        are some points, that come spontaneously to my mind when I think about 

        Bardons errors. Probably I forgot some. On the other hand, I'm not the 

        person who looks pedantically for errors in Bardons work. If I find other 

        errors by chance in the future, I will add them here.</font></p>

      <hr width="100%">

      <h3 align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="epilog"></a>Epilogue</font></h3>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

        will keep this epilogue and resume very short and concise.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although 

        one can find serious errors in Bardons work I have nevertheless the opinion, 

        that his system is the best one published until now.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

        can therefore not at all share Hembergers view and that of other critics 

        of Franz Bardon. Those people are in my opinion not intelligent enough 

        that they can see the real relevance of Bardons system.</font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, 

        last but not least, I'm not sorry at all about the fact, that this article 

        will displease some people, who are trying to establish Bardon as the 

        new Messiah.</font></p>
