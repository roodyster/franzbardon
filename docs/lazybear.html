<P><B> Warning</B>: to whomever reads these pages and is not intimately
familiar with Bardon's three books (see below). Much that appears here will not
be understandable, and may in fact seem altogether incomprehensible. After all,
who in their right mind would imagine that <I>magic</I> could be real. This
part of my cyber-home is not for the idle curious. Nevertheless, those who have
some interest in aboriginal spiritual ways, or Magik, Wicca, paganism, and other
attempts to reanimate the older spiritual pathways, may find what is below to be
an invaluable aid in their work. Those who are passionately against such things,
who disparage the &quot;new age&quot; without any real understanding of it or
the people who pursue these realities with great forces of heart, you nay-sayers
are invited elsewhere...there is nothing for you here.</P>
<P><B>Introduction: </B>Years ago, I read a book called the <B>Magic of
Findhorn</B>. Prior to that time, except for some odd experiments and
experiences, I was very much a rational materialist; and the idea of the magical
seemed nothing more than a pleasant foolishness. At this particular time in my
life, I was transitioning from an interest in Tibetan Buddhism and becoming more
and more fascinated with the views of Native American Medicine Teachers,
particularly the works of H. Storm (see below for details). While both above
points of view had their <I>magical</I> aspects, I was mostly interested in
their pyschology, their understanding of mind - of inner life.</P>
<P>However, on reading the <B>Magic of Findhorn</B>, I decided to investigate
these <I>magical</I> matters more closely and personally. I approached this
quest in the following way:</P>
<P>I had years before, after a trip to Yosemite National Park, made, out of
some fallen wood I found there, a magical staff - more as a kind of joke (so I
thought). I had painted on this staff reproductions of three major arcana from
the Paul Case Tarot, which were based on a reading done for me by my younger
brother (he also thought we were &quot;playing&quot;). The cards and their &quot;significance&quot;
are as follows: &quot;Inner self&quot; - the Zero Card - the Fool; &quot;Outer
self&quot; - the Nine Card - the Hermit; and, &quot;Life Destiny&quot; - the One
Card - the Magician. Subsequently, this staff was borrowed by a friend, and
taken to Ho Chi Min Park in Berkeley, CA, and was there stolen.</P>
<P>With this in mind, since I was going to investigate <I>magic</I>, I decided
to leave my house and go on a &quot;spirit walk&quot;, looking for the lost
staff. My understanding of a spirit-walk is to walk without conscious choice of
direction, following only the mood of the moment, but having no intended goal.
Within two blocks of my house, after making about three arbritrary turns, I
found myself walking by a bookstore, which I had passed by many times before,
but had never gone in, because the window only displayed poetry books, in which
I had no interest. This time I turned into the store.</P>
<P>On my immediate left was a small narrow bookcase, which had a small hand
lettered sign at the time, saying, &quot;Occultism&quot;. I looked over the
books for something on magic, but found none. I spoke up the clerk, who was in
the back of the store, &quot;Do you have any more books on magic or occultism?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No&quot;, he said, so I turned to leave. &quot;Wait&quot;, he said,
and when I looked back he was holding up a yellow cloth-bound book, which seemed
to have been right in front of him all the time. I walked back and looked at the
used and worn book, examining the table of contents and flipping through the
pages. It seemed to satisfy all that I, as a complete novice, could have asked
for in such a book. The clerk wanted $7.50, which was all the money I had in the
world at that time. I handed it over and he gave me a first edition English copy
of <B>The Practice of Magical Evocation</B>, by one Franz Bardon. (I never did
find the staff. All the other Bardon books came to me in similar ways. One fall,
several years later, I had to sell all my magic library to put food on my
family's table. I now own the books in the purple cloth-bound editions.)</P>
<P><B>Some General Comments</B>: When needed, the references to Bardon's works
will be made as follows: page number, then text (i.e. p.23 - <B>Initiation</B>);
with Initiation meaning: <B>Initiation into Hermetics</B>; Practice meaning:
<B>The Practice of Magical Evocation</B>; and Key meaning: <B>The Key to the
True Quabbalah</B>.</P>
<P>I do not consider <B>Frabato the Magician</B> legitiment, regardless of its
stated provenence. It may well be, I have no <I>occult</I> knowledge to the
contrary, but I do not like its style, it seems more imagined fiction then a
reflection of a lived life and and such a life's real moral dilemmas. Further,
the material in the back which purports to be notes for another book - a perhaps
fourth leaf from the <B>Tarot - </B>lacks the subtle and very very dry humor of
the originals. It seems more like someone else's ideas of what Bardon might have
said, and adds almost nothing to what has not already been better stated in the
original three volumns. Even the reference to abstinance from sex seems out of
place, because this problem is certainly implied in <B>Initiation</B>, and yet
was clearly and appropriately left to the practioners own choice. As the essay
below unfolds, the reader familiar with Frabato will come, I believe, to
understand better my reluctance to include it in the masterwork which the main
three texts represent.</P>
<P>It is also necessary to place Bardon's works within the general field of
occult liturature, which of course will ultimately be a matter of personal
taste. Those, who become familiar with the whole of my cyber-home, of which this
essay is only a small part, will realize that I have been strongly influenced by
Rudolf Steiner (the founder of Anthropsophy or Spiritual Science); Valentin
Tomberg (a one time anthroposophist, then later a Roman Catholic, and finally
the anonymous author of: <B>Meditations on the Tarot: a journey into Christian
Hermeticism</B>); Hyemeyohsts Storm (author of
<B>Seven Arrows</B>); the <B>Moody Blues</B> and their wonderful music and
lyrics; and, Chogyam Trungpa (an authentic teacher of Tibetan Buddhism, and
founder of the Naropa Institute of Boulder Colorado), in addition to Franz
Bardon.</P>
<P><B>Some Additional Remarks</B>: First, regarding my own experiences. Once I
had a copy of <B>Initiation,</B> I worked rather diligently for about three
years, achieving a early morning daily exercise period (sitting in the asana) of
about 1 and 1/2 hours of uninterrupted concentration and exercising (meditation
in the magical <I>style;</I> explicitly implying by this that there are a
number of meditation <I>styles</I> of which the magical one, as taught by
Bardon, is only one). I was working at inhaling the elements, Step III, when the
circumstances of my life suggested a change of emphasis. As this is a crucial
matter, I will describe it in some detail next.</P>
<P>In my outer life I was working at a repetory cinema (not first run movies)
in San Francisco, as a theater manager. I had become curious, due to my studies
of Bardon, about the spiritual and occult properties of plants, and had been
looking in the various bookstores in Berkeley California, where I was living,
for appropriate texts. One afternoon I chanced upon a book of lectures by Rudolf
Steiner, called (the) <B>Agriculture</B> (Course), at Shambala Books, and
bought a copy, going then across the street to the Mediterranian Cafe to begin
reading it. The book so impressed me within the first lecture, that I
immediately returned to Shambala Books, and bought two more Steiner &quot;lecture
cycles&quot;; the <B>Gospel of St John</B>, and the <B>Gospel of St Luke.</B></P>
<P>I will not say this was a decisive turning point in my life, for that would
be untrue. Rather, it was one more major transition on a very strong learning
curve that had begun, in my early thirties, with psychological work in the
California of the late 60's and early 70's, transitioning to studies of Tibetan
Buddhism (Chogyam Trungpa), then to Native American Shamanism (Storm's <B>Seven</B>
<B>Arrows</B>), to Bardon, to Steiner, to Tomberg. These are merely the
highlights; and, in the course of this work, I have never really left anything
behind, just tried to take the best of what I had learned, and what I might keep
learning and find some way to <I>integrate</I> it all and find the <I>whole</I>
truth of it. Trungpa, for example, convinced me early on, that the best way was
always to decide the truth of a thing for one's self (see his: <B>Meditation in
Action</B>), and this has remained a basic guide post.</P>
<P>Steiner, to give another example, spoke of the Gospel writers as all being
initiates of varying degrees and therefore writing about the Christ Events from
that individual perspective. They are all looking at the same thing, which I
will indicate in a basic way, as <I>the truth</I>, but each perspective is
different, as if each stood at a different place on the same mountain. This is
the way I look at Trungpa, Storm, Bardon, Steiner, Tomberg and so forth; they
are all initiates of different streams, and speak from these individual
perspectives.</P>
<P>Returning to the moment of transition from Bardon to Steiner ... The first
week after acquiring the Steiner books, I was reading them at the Larkin Theater
(I had quite a bit of spare time), when during my usual hourly rounds (check the
theater - walk through, show a presence) I stopped at the lobby ticket counter,
and began to make the hourly count - making sure the number of tickets sold
corresponded to the change in the cash register - when a very unusual man walked
up, and we began to have a conversation...</P>
<P>I had seen him once before, at least, in the theater, sitting in a seat,
with his eyes closed. He was dressed the same as before. He was short, mature -
silver haired - and wore tan (working) pants and shirt, with a dark blue
windbreaker. In the pocket of his shirt were two or three large cigars, and
tucked under one arm was a small oblong case (like a tiny flute case) wrapped in
newpaper and tied with string. I began speaking to him in a rather casual inane
way, inquiring after his need for senior citizen tickets, about his cigars and
so forth as I carried out my count. In the beginning he was not looking up at
me, but downward. As he was, perhaps, only five foot four (and I am six feet). I
could not initially see his face.</P>
<P>When he spoke, it was really rather shocking, although in a very subtle way,
because it was clear that his voice was resonating from his <I>whole</I> body.
This is difficult, of course, to imagine, but I know that if you had heard it,
there would be no doubt about it. I immediately glanced up from my paper work,
and he looked at me at the same time. When our eyes met I was inwardly
thunderstruck! I felt, at the deepest part of my soul, that my whole inner self
was completely naked; what I was, what I felt, what I thought - all that stood
revealed to him in an instant. </P>
<P>But this was not all. His eyes were completely clear. The iris's were bright
blue, but that aspect of the eye, which is the white part for us, was completely
clear - transparent, like the eye of a cat (excluding the cat's iris, which is
an elongated oval shape rather than circular like a human iris).</P>
<P>After buying a ticket, he interrupted my irrelevant chatter (I was logically
speechless, but not <I>quiet</I>), and said to me: &quot;Don't you want to do
something about that?&quot;</P>
<P>With great intelligence, I replied &quot;huh?&quot;</P>
<P>He repeated himself, to which I responded with an even greater clarity: &quot;what?&quot;.
After which, he repeated for a third time, saying: &quot;Don't you want to do
something about that&quot; and then gestured with his arm, vigorously pointing
to the world outside the glass wall of the front of the theater.</P>
<P>Then he turned and walked into the theater proper. Once, months later, I
thought I saw him from the back, when I was riding on a bus in downtown San
Francisco, but, otherwise I never saw him again. [Lest one be tempted to think,
this is a bizarre and isolated event, I suggest that they listen to the English
rock group the <B>Moody Blues</B>, especially the eighth album - <B>Octave</B>;
in particular the references in the first song to meeting a man whose eyes were
clear, who taught of a magic stream, and how the apple grows; and then the
following song which speaks of being &quot;under moonshine, that's where I'm
seen...&quot; - see below about the different planetary qualities][see also,
elsewhere on my cyber-home, my discussion of the<A
HREF="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.microweb.com/hermit/aipmb.html'))window.location='http://www.microweb.com/hermit/aipmb.html'" tppabs="http://www.microweb.com/hermit/aipmb.html"><B><I>meaning in Moody Blues
Lyrics</I></B></A>]</P>
<P>Of course the question for me was what does this all mean, leaving aside for
the moment, who the heck he was etc.</P>
<P>From Steiner's part of the mountain, it appears that spiritual ways or paths
are intimately connected to particular qualitative aspects of the <I>landscape</I>
of the invisible world. It is possible then to speak of different systems as
having a connection to the Saturn Quality, or the Moon or the Sun, and so forth.
From this point of view, Buddhism and Magic are Moon wisdoms, Christianity and
Anthroposophy are Sun wisdoms, and Native American Spirituality is a Saturn
wisdom. [for more about Sun matters, see also on my cyber-home:
<A HREF="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.microweb.com/hermit/eldbr.html'))window.location='http://www.microweb.com/hermit/eldbr.html'" tppabs="http://www.microweb.com/hermit/eldbr.html"><B><I>The Message from
the True White Brother</I></B>]</A></P>
<P>After years of wondering about the mystery of this encounter I have
discovered two aspects to it. One aspect is that at that particular moment in my
own path, I was transitioning from Saturn and Moon wisdoms (Trungpa, Storm and
Bardon) to Sun wisdoms (Steiner and Tomberg). The second is that a <I>Being</I>
- I hesitate to say a man - appeared to me and blessed this transition by
reminding me of something that I had lost during the political turbulence of the
60's and 70's, namely the belief that something could be done about the World. I
had, as many had, retreated into deep spiritual practice, my soul bruised and
bloodied by the battle with the dragon that occurred in those years. Yes, I did
learn afterwards, that I still did care and still did want to do something about
the World.</P>
<P>The most ripe fruit of that subsequent labor is found on my cyber-home at:
<B><I><A HREF="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.microweb.com/hermit/stgfr.html'))window.location='http://www.microweb.com/hermit/stgfr.html'" tppabs="http://www.microweb.com/hermit/stgfr.html">Strange Fire: the
Death, and the Resurrection, of Modern Civilization.</A></I></B></P>
<P>So, after I began my studies of Steiner and all that followed, what did I do
with Bardon and his work? This is next.</P>
<P><B>A Problem of Time: </B>Steiner produced over the course of his life
several dozen written texts, as well as over 6,000 lectures, many of which have
been transcribed and published. In addition, his inspiration has resulted in an
outpouring of books from others. In order to take this phenomenal treasure in,
and give it the time it most certainly deserved, required some degree of
sacrifice. I also, in my outer life at this time, entered into a second marriage
and fathered, ultimately, two more children (bringing the total to five). Thus,
slowly over time, I ceased certain elements of my Bardon practices, and replaced
them with work following after the pathway pioneered by Steiner and his
associates.</P>
<P>It needs to be clearly understood that Steiner was not offering merely a
different spiritual point of view, but a fundamental alteration of one's inner
life, by bringing to it a greater awakeness on multiple levels of soul and
spiritual perception. Just the reorientation required by actually understanding,
in practice, his philosophical writings is a major undertaking. See in this
regard, again elsewhere on my cyber-home:<A
HREF="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.microweb.com/hermit/stgfr5.html'))window.location='http://www.microweb.com/hermit/stgfr5.html'" tppabs="http://www.microweb.com/hermit/stgfr5.html"><B><I>pragmatic moral

(I see no point in repeating these matters here.) In addition, to learn the
practice of <I>goetheanism</I> (also pointed to and begun by Steiner), which is
a whole new phase in the development of science, is again a work in itself (see
again <B><I>The Quiet</I></B>....above). Since my own impulses had to do with
deepening my understanding of social life, I was faced with the problem of
trying (but not achieving in a satisfactory way) to translate goetheanistic
observation and thinking practices into a means for greater perception of social
and political realities. See in this regard, also on this aspect of the
aether-loom:
<B><I><A HREF="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.microweb.com/hermit/thpts.html'))window.location='http://www.microweb.com/hermit/thpts.html'" tppabs="http://www.microweb.com/hermit/thpts.html">Threshold Problems

Giant: the mission of Anthroposophy in America</I></B>.</A></P>
<P>Returning to Bardon...What I have decided to keep, after this time, is the
first step (Step I, <B>Initation</B>) practice. This is not as easy as it
seems, if you carefully consider the elements of that Step. If one understands
the creative possibilities offered in this Step, then unusual opportunities
arise. For example, a certain time of day can be set aside, best in my
experience immediately after rising, when the rest of the household and the
world are still quiet and resting. The brushing of the body, the washing of the
eyes and body, the stretching, a certain amount of meditation and prayer in the
<I>magical style</I>, to which can be added, at the end of the day, some
purposeful reflection and work in a diary - all this can be done in a
ritualistic fashion, so that every gesture and movement and accompanying thought
carries forward and reflects that matters of concern and study of the moment.</P>
<P>This is difficult. The mind wants constantly to wander, the gestures to be
semi-conscious. So that in bringing creative discipline to Step I,
<B>Initiation</B>, there is a great work to accomplish. Tomberg, in his
<B>Inner Development</B>, writes of the effectiveness of the rhythmic
repetitions, slowing building the course of development, small step by small
step. In Bardon (p 255, <B>Key</B>) we have this statement: &quot;Rituals, too,
have normally to be repeated 462 times, in order to make the necessary volting
so strong that it works automatically.&quot;</P>
<P>Since, during my more intimate studies of his work, I probably read each
book in detail at least a half a dozen times, and have returned to them again
and again at various necessary intervals, I was eventually able to see - in all
life experiences - how, certain phenomena, both inner and outer, also reveal
<I>the universal laws</I>, as described in Bardon's work. You could say, that
because of my studies of Bardon, whatever I looked at, whether Steiner,
goetheanism, or whatever, I could always see an additional dimension to it,
corresponding to <I>the key of the elements</I>. And, of course, always
meditation, but now with the added dimensions brought by Steiner and Tomberg -
that is reaching for a unity of Saturn, Moon and Sun qualities in the work; but
more especially, how one lived in the course of the ordinary day. <I>This was
where all my questions centered. How did I live among my fellow men? With what
qualties of soul and spirit? Everyone's answer here is no doubt, in fact must
be, <B>individual.</B></I></P>
<P>Certain decisions accompanied this process. Some are decribed above, others,
to follow, are more related to Bardon; for in the course of my own wandering
development I discovered in Bardon's texts<B>, a second level of meaning. </B>Let
me begin this next part with a concrete example.</P>
<P>&quot;All this clearly shows that a true magic circle is really the best
means to practice ceremonial magic. The magician will always find that the magic
circle is, in every respect, the highest symbol in his hand.&quot;<B></B>(p 27,
<B>Practice</B>)</P>
<P>The above statement follows a very long and beautiful description of various
types of magic circles, how they can be constructed and the significance in the
meaning of the circle, as well as its point as an aid in ritual magic.</P>
<P>Let us now picture inwardly, with the imagination, a meditating magician,
siting in his asana, and holding his hands - the palm up, with the thumb and
first finger finger tip to finger tip, making the symbol of the circle - &quot;...the
highest symbol in his hand&quot;.</P>
<P>No more ceremony is necessary. No elaborate cloth, no waving of wands or
knives (as in Wicca), only the forming of the fingers into the appropriate
symbol. All that is needed to aid the consciousness in guiding it to the
significance of the circle is contained in that simple gesture, which is
pictured throughout the Orient as one element of <I>mudra</I> (hand ritual
symbolism) (see also Bardon's own indications concerning ritual and
gesticulation - Step IV, <B>Initiation</B>).</P>
<P>Let us continue with a look at the symbolism of the triangle, which Bardon
refers to next...</P>
<P>At the <I>end</I> of the section on the Magic Triangle:</P>
<P>&quot;Following the principles which by now are already well known to the
magician, each power or being will only have effects within the spheres into
which it has been called and in which it has been condensed. This means that,
for instance, a being projected into the mental sphere will naturally not be
able to influence the physical world, but will only become effective in the
mental world.&quot; (p 31, <B>Practice</B>)</P>
<P>When sitting in the asana, with our arms and hands arrayed so that we are
relaxed and can form the symbolism of the circle with our fingers, the
arrangement of our head, torso, arms and hands, forms a natural triangle.
<I>We are</I> that triangle, and our soul - our inner world - exists within the
triangle, and we can, if we act properly, call into the mental sphere
<I>there encompassed</I> those <I>beings</I> which we wish.</P>
<P>This should be enough hints to get the general picture, but so that there is
complete clarity I will elaborate.</P>
<P>In the Bardon texts, it appears to me that, there is at least more than one
level of meaning, and the level which one finds is accord with certain qualities
as those manifest in the reader. These levels should not be construed to by
higher or lower, but rather what is appropriate to the individual needs of the
practitioner and the assumptions and desires that each individual brings to the
text. The text then, and perhaps this explains the seemingly odd quality of the
writing, functions like a mirror does, granting to the reader <I>that meaning
which he already intends to find</I>.</P>
<P>Those, who seek for powers and intercourse with strange beings, will find
their way following Bardon. Not only that, but if they follow his guidance
carefully, they will find their way without falling into all the dangerous side
paths, which have historically marked the byways of the practice of <I>magic</I>.</P>
<P>Those who seek a deep path of meditation (the reader intimate with Bardon
will recall how often he makes a statement such as &quot;...the meditating
magician...&quot; or &quot;...the meditating scholar...&quot;) will find, again,
the best guidance if they accept Bardon as the teacher of the <I>way</I> to
practice the magic <I>style</I>.</P>
<P>Having reached this point, it will do to add some additional considerations.</P>
<P>At a certain point in my own practice I began to wonder about what kind of
<I>relationship</I> I wanted to have with the<I> beings</I> of the invisible
world. Much of Bardon's language describes the magician as one who is <I>obeyed</I>.
This implies to me that the magician was to see his will as dominating the will
of the being which was to be evoked or otherwise communicated with. Since I had
earlier reached the conclusion that I did not want to have such a relationship
with any <I>human</I> being - a relationship where my will ran over their
freedom (except, in certain circumstances, such as children and others in need
of special care), with what justification did I desire to command the hosts of
the invisible world? How could I want to force an invisible being to have
contact with me against its will? What kind of relationship was that?</P>
<P>I had no doubt it was something which could be done, at least as regards
lower levels of invisible beings, but did I think I had, or could have, the will
forces to <I>command</I>, for example, Archangel Michael?</P>
<P>Gradually I began to let go of the idea, incorporated into my consciousness
through comic books and other immature depictions of the life of a magician, of
having powers and commanding principalities, and in this way began to understand
the admonition in the Bible concerning the dangers of contact with such members
of the invisible kingdoms.</P>
<P>As these matters started to slide away, another vision of the possibilities
began to appear. The magic <I>style</I> of meditation could enable one,
depending upon one's maturity and forces of will, to learn mental traveling for
the purpose of advancing human civilization. In such a case, what need was there
to force an invisible being from its natural realm into the physical world,
merely to show my power over it. Could I not, instead, develop myself
sufficiently so that I could rise up, into the invisible world, and there, as a
neophyte among new friends, find out in what ways I could make a contribution to
the elimination of human suffering?</P>
<P>&quot;Considering the universal polarity rules of good and evil, active and
passive, light and shadow, each science can serve good as well as bad
purposes...All depends on the character of the individual.&quot; (p 9,
<B>Initiation</B>)</P>
<P>Having developed now, I hope quite clearly, the idea of <I>individual</I>
<I>interpretation of meaning</I> and its significance in the study of Bardon's
works, I would like to take up one last theme. For those who want to pursue the
philosophical justification for this point of view concerning meaning and
intention, thought and experience, I direct them to Steiner's: <B>The Theory of
Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception.</B></P>
<P><B>Who Was/Is Franz Bardon? </B>Certainly someone carried this name in life
and, from what little I have read, left behind a normal trail and evidence of
experiences - such as personal relationships and so forth. I have not personally
made an effort to know Bardon's real biography, although, as indicated above, I
do not regard <B>Fabrato the Magician</B> as equal to the task.</P>
<P>Those who are familiar with the life of other modern initiates, know that
each of them has had, as well, a personal teacher, someone who did not become a
public figure, but remained out of the light, and served as a helper and guide
to the one whose destiny it was to write books and give lectures and perhaps
acquire living students.</P>
<P>Bardon makes no overt hint as to this, yet he does continually make
reference to what he calls &quot;Divine Providence&quot;, a concept not unknown
in ancient or modern times. We would do well, I believe, to recognize this as a
hierarchy of beings lead by one <I>High Being</I>, a spiritual entity of deep
and profound authority in the world, and who is not just some kind of karmic
life coordinator. Divine Providence is not a law (even the so-called <I>universal
laws are the deeds of beings</I>). It is only in the age of materialistic
science that we have divorced the idea of <I>force</I> in the universe, from
the idea of the <I>will</I> of Cosmic Beings. So there is a question: Who was
the Cosmic Being who over saw the writing of these books, which books are, as
Bardon himself has said, unparalleled in the field of hermetic occultism?</P>
<P>This problem gets a little more complicated. Over the years of my own
reading, I have encountered two additional texts, which I believe relate to this
question. The names of these books are <B>Practical Astrology</B> and <B>Practical
Palmistry</B>. They are currently in print and published by Newcastle, and
allege themselves to have been written by Saint Germain.</P>
<P>At first blush, one is tempted to dismiss the idea that the Count de St.
Germain had left behind any written material at all, and that these texts must
be, as is often the case with books of occultism, the works of someone else who
sought to gain some kind of advantage by having their own work attributed to the
mysterious St. Germain. However, when one makes a study of these books, the
matter becomes more complicated because there is every reason to believe that
only an initiate could have written them. I will deal with them in order.</P>
<P><B>Practical Astrology</B> is, as it begins, just a very simple book of
astrology, written with a kind of droll voice, the author not wanting us to take
it all <I>too</I> seriously<B>. </B>Yet, there is no other astrology text
existant (even the reborn astrology which comes from Steiner students, and which
calls itself <I>Astrosophy</I>) that contains this material and is arranged in
the manner of this text.</P>
<P>Everyone, who investigates occult matters, soon knows of the existence of
tarot, astrology and numerology, rather individual systems, all elaborated in
modern times in such a multitude of ways, that one could get quite dizzy trying
to keep up with them. Most people have a favorite system, and a favorite author,
if they haven't decided to invent their own way of doing it.</P>
<P><B>Practical Astrology</B>, which declares itself to be the true method by
which the ancient Egyptians practiced these disciplines, presents Egyptian
astrology as a complete integration of the systems of tarot, astrology and
numerology - not three systems side by side, but as an integrated -
interpenetrating - whole. This is not, by the way, through some kind of table of
correspondences, as some modern texts will do, but rather, you can't do the
astrology without first using the principles of numerology to translate the
birth name appropriately, and then using what the author calls &quot;fatidic
circles&quot;, that advise as to where to place the planets and the relevant
tarot symbols in the astrological chart.</P>
<P>These are not the only differences, there are many others. However, there is
one unusual major one I have not yet mentioned, which is that the whole thing
works without an ephemeris or other reference to the actual position of the
stars! I have used this system only occassionally, there were too many other
pressing concerns to practice it religiously, but it did clearly predict the one
time I asked it for what is called a horoscope of revolution (a reading for the
current year) that I would suffer a major illness (this in my 42nd year), which
did in fact occur.</P>
<P><B>Practical Palmistry</B> presents similar amazing elements. I will only
give a few details. The author recommends to approach this science with a
certain degree of discipline. When hands are examined, an ink pad and other
materials should be used in order to obtain a palm print, which is retained by
the practitioner so that study and skill can develop and assesments which are
made can be reviewed and checked later against events as they happen.</P>
<P>The author further recommends that a magnifying glass be used so that no
details are missed. It is not just a matter of the major lines and bumps, but of
noticing the details which enables the practitioner to render a more specific
appraisal.</P>
<P>In giving a theoretical explanation of why the hand can be used in the way
tradition has suggested, the author asks the observer to notice that the
patterns on the hand are quite similar to that pattern one might find in the
sand, where the tides draw a river in and out of the ocean at the rivers mouth.
The implication is that the pattern in the hand is the result of the plasticity
of the body being imprinted with the inflow and outflow of the <I>life forces</I>
which flow most strongly in and out of the body wherever it narrows itself down
to points in its form. Students of Steiner will know that his researches into
invisible realms gave him a great deal of knowledge about the <I>etheric body</I>,
which is also called the time body and is said to contain, among much else, all
the thoughts we will ever think.</P>
<P>Students of Bardon should realize that this flow is also the <I>light</I>
which one is taught to work with in the initial practices of conscious pore
breathing. In fact, for Bardon students wanting to appreciate more deeply
working with the <I>light</I>, I recommend a thorough study of the work done by
Steiner students on projective geometry, which is the mathematics of the <I>etheral
realm</I> - the realm of the <I>light</I>. Examples of these texts can be found
elsewhere on my cyber-home at: <B><I><A

<P>Hopefully, from these brief words the reader will understand why I believe
these books to have been authored by an initiate. Now to complicate matters even
more.</P>
<P>In reading these books attributed to Saint Germain, and, as well, the books
of Franz Bardon, I have constantly felt that the same <I>mind</I> (spirit)
wrote all five books! The reader will of course have the arduous task of
confirming (or not) these suspicions for himself.</P>
<P>So, who is/was Franz Bardon, and who is/was his guide and teacher?</P>
<P>Just for the fun of it (after all we have to be careful not to take
ourselves too seriously in some senses and, of course, completely seriously in
many other ways if we want <I>quality</I> to exist in our work, or <I>morality</I>,
for that matter), let me take this all the way out and share with you my sense
of these things at their deepest level. Consider this a kind of spiritual tale,
as it were, not stated as complete truth, because I come to knowledge of these
ideas in a derivative way - through reading the work of others. In assembling
them into the tale below, it is also possible that I have made errors, so it all
should be taken with a grain of salt.</P>
<P>Steiner, in various places, speaks of Christ as a Sun Being, as a Cosmic
Being, who at one time had His abode in the spiritual Sun Sphere. At the
beginning of the time of the Egyptians, the Caladonians and the Babylonians,
this being was called Ahura Mazdo, by the Zorathustran mysteries of ancient
Persia. This exhaulted Sun Being has as an opponent a dark god called Ahriman
(See also my novel - partially completed and also on my cyber-home: <B><I><A
HREF="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.microweb.com/hermit/ertrg1.html'))window.location='http://www.microweb.com/hermit/ertrg1.html'" tppabs="http://www.microweb.com/hermit/ertrg1.html">Earth Ranger 2323</A></I></B>).</P>
<P>According to the modern Christian initiates (Steiner and Tomberg) this Sun
Being eventually incarnated in the body of Jesus, at the baptism at the Jorden,
and lived on the Earth for about two and a third years, leaving behind profound
and deep teachings, which are still not well understood or practiced.</P>
<P>From another point of view, the Christ, as a Sun Being, is carried by seven
Elohim, true Sun Beings, as the Christ is, cosmically, of an even higher order
than the Sun Sphere. During that period when the Nation of Israel was being
formed from the various nomadic peoples of that region of the Earth, one of
these Elohim sacrificed his Sun existence to become the God Yahweh, a
representative of Cosmic influences that was to oversee the development of the
Jewish race and its destiny, up to the time of the Incarnation, when the other
six Elohim would bear the Christ into the Earth.</P>
<P>Are your with me so far?</P>
<P>Now one consequence of this is that the Yahweh Elohim becomes irrevocably
bound up with the destiny of the Earth, which itself is of a whole other order
than Cosmic existence. This Elohim, having sacrificed his Sun existence is now
connected to the Moon Sphere aspect of the invisible world's <I>landscape -
</I>that Sphere which is most concerned with condensation and materialization.
In a sense, this <I>being</I> - the Yahweh Elohim - must follow the path of the
elements, it is tied to the elements. This being the case, it is no wonder then
that the practice of magic, as a system of initiation, is based upon the
tetragrammaton, the YHVH, the four pole magnet, the mystery of the elements;
and, therefore, it is this Elohim who oversaw/sees, at some level, the work of
St.Germain, Franz Bardon, and that circle of co-workers, which includes all
modern students of Bardon.</P>
<P>My own view is that it is the Yahweh Elohim that stands behind Divine
Providence, and who graced me with a visit one day to send my still too lazy
behind packing onward from the stream of wisdom he/she/it personally oversaw and
into the one, the Sun wisdom, to which his brother Elohim are now connected to
due to their relationship to the Christ.</P>
<P>The reason I share this material is that I want to encourage not only a
deeper study of Bardon, but the broadening of that study to include much else
besides. And further, I want those who wander into these pages and actually get
some sense from them, to realize that we are not alone, and that all that we do
on the Earth is seen by Cosmic Beings, who are waiting for us to again turn to
them, but now, as fully conscious individuals and out of complete freedom. They
cannot speak to us, unless we make a place in our hearts and in our meditative
life for just this kind of <I>communion.</I>
<I>We ought never to command their presence, and probably will never deserve
their grace, but surely they will find a way to work with us, if we but seek to
learn love.</I></P>
