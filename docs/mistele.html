</STRONG>  </H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>1/9/97:  Franz Bardon gives a sigil for Itumo.  This is a symbolic diagram 
which can be used to form a connection to a spirit or elemental being.   Itumo's
sigil represents an electrical charge growing stronger and stronger.   It is
drawn in yellow and, using my mind, I draw it in the air in front of  me.       
Some might consider a sigil to be nothing more than an a scribble on a  piece of
paper and everything I say about it to be pure fantasy.  But after  decades of
working with other psychics, comparing notes, and engaging in a  vast variety of
experiments, you build up a feeling for this sort of thing.   Like a computer
hacker with a new program, you already have the habit of  working with something
until you get the result you want.     Even as I begin to draw the first of the
intersecting angles in the  sigil, the tip of my finger begins to tingle with an
electrical sensation.  The air in the room also feels as if the pressure has
increased as when your  ears pop when you are riding in an airplane as it drops
down from a higher  altitude.        Off and on during this evocation I sense
the presence of an electrical  storm whirling about me.  Itumo seems to radiate
the energy of a storm the  way a sailor carries with him the feeling of  the sea
or a nomad the  desolation of a desert.          I connect  psychically to Itumo
not only by drawing the sigil but also  by feeling his aura. Though I have very
little natural rapport with the fire  element and find it extremely difficult to
concentrate on fire and heat,  it  is easy for me to gain a sense of the mind of
a being such as Itumo.       After entering his realm and attuning myself to
Itumo's mind, he appears  before me as a young man.   His aura is white tinged
with yellow.  Sparks  fly off of his hair.  I also sense in his presence a
powerful magnetic field  such as is around a horseshoe magnet five feet wide and
ten feet tall. I  notice too that the hand with which I drew his sigil feels
slightly numb. It  is  the way your hand may feel when it falls asleep but
before the prickly  sensation sets in.       In my experience, the twenty-four
elemental beings mentioned by Bardon  are adept in working with the connection
between the astral and physical  planes.  They are interested in nature but they
are masters of the  particular energies which stand behind nature.  On the
mental plane, the  different kinds of elemental beings have powerful forms of
concentration  relating to their element.  And, since they are all magicians,
they also  work to a limited extent with akasha--the awareness which controls
and from  which their element is generated.  As with the other elemental beings
I  write about, I like to explore their sense of each of the four planes--the 
akasha, the mental, the astral, and the physical.     AKASHIC PLANE  I say to
Itumo, &quot;Meditate with me on the akashic plane.&quot;  Without even 
blinking his eyes, he focuses his awareness and we enter a timeless,  spaceless,
and formless state of mind.        Itumo says, &quot;Of all salamanders, I know
the most about love.  This is  because I work constantly with the element which
is my opposite--with water.   It carries my charge.  Water's magnetism and its
powers I use and respect  the way a man uses a woman to bring himself into focus
and to fulfill the  desires within his heart.  I have discovered as human
lovers' discover that  to know oneself requires the gulf that separates one from
another be  crossed.      &quot;A man's love for a woman reveals what is hidden
within himself.   His  love for her takes him on a journey on an unknown path. 
Her beauty hurls  him into a wilderness of pain so great he can only escape by
recreating   himself--by allowing her energy and spirit to enter him and
transform him  from within.       &quot;So it is that the lightning I forge in
the thunderstorm is the same  mysterious power which is concealed in the
attraction between a man and a  woman.  Humans sense this attraction and respond
to it seeking pleasure,  love, and connection.  But for me, this attraction is
magic.  It is a place  I enter to master myself.         &quot;The mage whose
wand creates new worlds uses my skill. When the mage  speaks words of power so
great they shape reality his innermost being is one  with his dream.  His power
gives birth, like the earth,  by cloaking spirit  in flesh and offering it a
world in which to flourish.  He is both the womb  which nurtures and the seed
which carries the destiny of spirit within it.   Magic masters both masculine
electricity and the feminine magnetism which  contains, nurtures, and amplifies
it.&quot;      I ask Itumo, &quot;If I understand you, the power you seek
derives from  mastering the opposite energies of masculine and feminine,
electric and  magnetic, and the force of attraction they generate?&quot;      
Itumo replies, &quot;This is not really the right question.  The forces I  use
are not the source of my inspiration. Rather, the question is, `What  voice sang
me into being and what mystery do I reveal?'&quot;      As Itumo speaks, there
is an image in his eyes of lightning flashing on  the horizon--a continuous
pulsing of flashes between the earth and the sky  going on not for a microsecond
but without stopping.     Itumo, for all the dazzling and electrical feeling
about him, also  reminds me of how I feel when I gaze into a sky full of stars. 
The stars  are both incredibly distant but the sky itself which holds the stars
is  cloaked in stillness.  This stillness brings the stars so near I can feel 
them within my heart.        Responding to my feelings, Itumo says, &quot;I am
closer to the secret you  conceal within yourself than any other being on earth.
 Oh, from others you  will learn more about wisdom and  love.  But within me is
the dream of your  unknown destiny.  That is why you have sought me out&quot;   
I notice that Itumo's presence in my room is unusually strong.  I have  found
that undines like Istiphul can create astonishing feelings of  connection and
love.  Even so, working with undines requires an effort.   They are present in
my world only to the extent I invite them to come near  by evoking the presence
of the sea.  But my connection to Itumo is much  stronger.  The mere thought of
him is enough to call forth his presence.      I am reminded at this moment of a
tiny little chapel on the second  floor of the student center where I went to
college.  Hardly anyone seemed  to know about it. When I went in and sat down
the energy in the air grew so  thick I was forced to get up and leave.  The
energy charge was more than I  could bear.  But I was not forced out because I
did not belong.  I was  pushed out because I was not ready.       This is not an
energy any Christian saint ever reflected upon in his or  her devotions.  If you
ascribe to God the attribute of being all power and  might, then it just might
be He has a few tricks up his sleeve, a few  archangels roaming about of whom
the church has never  imagined or conceived  even in its dreams.   I never spoke
of this to anyone until now because  theologians have never been able to answer
my questions.  Their concerns are  not with the universe, the search for truth,
or the process of discovery but  with how to justify what they already believe. 
  The next time I ran into this feeling is when I watched the Hopi Indian 
priests on third mesa calling the clouds to rain through their Katchina  dances.
 The land around the three mesas is a desert and yet the Hopi manage  to farm
it.  You pick up the soil in your hand and it feels like sand.  And  yet out in
the desert you can still see Indians hoeing between ears of blue  corn as you
drive by.       I remember a young boy offering me some of their piki bread made
out of  blue corn as I sat waiting for a snake dance.  The bread was very thin
and  rolled up--a real delicacy.  And one of the Hopi medicine men who offered
to  teach me about herbs carried this fine ground corn powder in his pouch.  The
 crops in these desert lands are nourished by the power which calls the  clouds
and brings the rain.       As the Indians dance with snakes in their mouths,
dark clouds drift over  the desert and lightning flashes down.  When you touch
the snake, when you  take it into your hands, in the sacred dance, you feel the
magnetism within  the earth.  You feel it seeking to uncoil within yourself. 
You look over at  the rocky mesas,  into the russet ravines, over at the
vermillion and chalk  cliffs, you walk among huge boulders next to streams--the
land no longer  feels inanimate, cold, or barren.  It feels like it is part of
your  body.   Like the electricity within the heart, the land builds up a charge
waiting  for the right moment to release.      And the clouds flowing through
the sky--if you listen you can hear their  songs.  They are not  twenty miles
distant. You can feel them like a fine  mist flowing over your skin.  You can
feel them as you watch them drift upon  the wind.  The Chinese physician can
determine from the pulse within your  wrist the health and vitality of your
internal organs.  But if you open you  heart you can feel the pulse within the
earth.  And as you watch the  lightning strike you can feel, like the beating of
the heart, the power  which nourishes all life to the earth.      Itumo says, &quot;The
positive and the negative charge--the force within the  shells of atoms--hear my
voice when I speak.  My power to command rises from  who I am.  Even the wind
hears my call and rises to form thunderclouds or  calms and is still according
to my will.   Fire is present even when it is  invisible, unmanifest, and air
can not sense it anywhere.        &quot;I can in expand my aura to encompass a
thunderstorm as easily as you  can command your fingers to from a fist  But you
want to know, don't you,  how I create lightning where no electricity flows,
where there is no  polarity or differential in potential charge?  It is very
easy.  I just  imagine what I want and then it comes about.&quot;     &quot;But
how did you learn that? I ask.  &quot;After all, to develop a magical  will you
must already be aware that there is magic within yourself.  Where  did you
start?  What was your beginning?&quot;      Itumo replies, &quot;There was a
time long ago when I was small and  insignificant.  Causing lightning to strike
was beyond my ability.  I was so  weak I could not make electricity surge. I
could not cause a spark to leap.  Neither atoms nor molecules would listen when
I spoke. The attraction they  felt for each other was beyond my perception.     
&quot;Yet even then I was still what I am now--an intelligence with the will  to
master electricity.  My commission was also the same as now:  to forge  paths
where none exist between mind, matter, and spirit.  I conceal the  mystery of
how to gather strength in silence until the power that is  unleashed is great
enough to cross every gulf and abyss so the desires of  the heart can be
fulfilled.  The silence that cloaks my will is the same  silence woven into the
sky that holds the stars within a vast embrace of  stillness.&quot;     &quot;Then
is the mystery of who you are something you unfolded and developed  on your own?&quot;
I ask.          Itumo replies, &quot;There are times when you must act alone for
there  is no one there to guide you.&quot;     Itumo and I just stare into each
other's eyes measuring the depths and  how we have explored silence in our
separate ways.  Itumo then says,  &quot;Because something is simple it does not
mean it is easy to do.  I am saying  you already know how to enter a place of
silence where the only thing that  exists is your own will, your own vision, and
the power of your own  imagination.&quot;     And then as if challenged by my
demand that he reveal the path he  followed, Itumo says, &quot;Come with me.&quot;
 And he takes me back to where his  mind once was when he had no power other
than the ability to observe.  He  says, &quot;Even in my mind at this time I can
see quite clearly that everything  has an electronic oscillation.  The leaf on
this tree.&quot;  And he takes in his  hand an oak leaf and hands it to me.     
Itumo goes on, &quot;You can feel, can't you, the metallic minerals in the  soil
beneath the tree vibrating within the leaf.  You can feel the process  of
photosynthesis--the leaf energized by the sun with a riotous enthusiasm  to
transform light into chemistry.  You can feel the carbon and the oxygen  being
realigned with more zeal and determination than a production line.&quot;    And
then Itumo smiles and laughs and says, &quot;And look at this.  I see you  can
feel as I do the way the liquids within the leaf animate the entire  tree.  The
tree is nourishing, giving, yielding, and receptive.  Touching  the tree is like
holding the hand of a woman.  The tree is a living being.  It responds to your
thoughts.  And for you, when you synchronize your mind  to the tree, the tree
becomes a transmitter.  Your spirit awakens its voice  and infuses it with
personality so it can share with you visions which, as  an organic being, it
perceives more clearly than you.&quot;     At this point, I am actually having a
hard time listening to Itumo's  words as he reads my mind like a telepath and
speaks with the hypnotic voice  of a bard.   As I touch the tree, I feel
connected to it just as he says, as  if it is the hand of a woman I am holding. 
One Taoist master I know teaches  how to exchange energy with another person so
there is one continuous flow  of vitality and life moving through the meridians
in two individuals'  bodies.   There is then one linked circuit so that the
masculine and  feminine energy of the two partners is harmonized and balanced.  
   It is very hard, however,  even for long time practitioners of such arts,  to
find partners who are willing to share this level of connection.  There  are
very few who seek such a profound degree of intimacy.  They sense  immediately
that opening the heart to let another in this far is too  dangerous when the
other may depart leaving them with only emptiness.       And so in our world it
is rare to find a teacher in any tradition who  teaches that becoming one with
all things is a way of being--that love is a  way of discovering yourself and of
celebrating the beauty of the universe.   Such love requires knowing how to made
peace with emptiness and also how to  be ready in any instant to attain the
highest intimacy possible with another  or with the world in which we live.  But
the oak tree, I notice, has no such  qualms about sharing.  The tree is like the
earth.  It knows how to give all  of itself without holding anything back.  And
it knows how to nourish its  own dreams in silence regardless of others'
response.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
