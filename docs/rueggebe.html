<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">To the friends of Franz Bardon's teachings !</H3>
<P>As I became aware that there are some papers around, which contain scathing
attacks on Franz Bardon and which try to distort his teachings, I would like, as
the trustee of Bardon's bequest, to comment on some of these twisted
informations.</P>
<P>To become a magician is no thing to play around with and by careless use of
this ART students may be seduced to perform thoughtless actions.</P>
<P>These imprudent actions may lead to serious states of illness, that most
often are then allotted by fault to the author.</P>
<P>Therefore I will repeat in the following material the most important
warnings and requirements, which Franz Bardon integrated as hurdles in his
works, to protect reckless people from performing thoughtless actions and to
safeguard their health.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">On &quot;The Franz Bardon Foundation&quot; in the U.S.A.</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">by Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg (27. August 1997)</P>
<P>In 1987 a Mr. <B>Jim Milligan</B> founded the &quot;Franz Bardon Foundation&quot;.
I never received any support for the work of Franz Bardon from this &quot;Foundation&quot;,
in the contrary at first I supported it with free books. Yet soon Jim Milligan
showed his real character by changing his name into &quot;Jim Bardon&quot; in
order to be able to ... (censured) his clients more easily.</P>
<P>Thereupon I mailed him the following letter:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Franz Bardon Foundation<BR>P.O.Box 4869<BR>Denver,
Colorado 80204<BR>USA   <BR>22. June 1987</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Dear Jim,
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">with amazement I have taken notice of the change of your name,
as stated on FBN-No. 6. We have already a guy here in Germany calling himself &quot;The
Representative of Urgaya&quot; and this one is already one to much in my eyes.
It is not my duty to criticize people like you, therefore I simply want to state
here the meaning of psychology about deeds like yours. From the psychological
standpoint the change of your name is an act of utmost disregard against Franz
Bardon and Urgaya! The qualities of character belonging to such a disregard you
can read after in any good book about the human character. It is simply the same
as if someone would call himself &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The student of magic knows that the master has the choice to
call his disciples, and not vice versa. Humble words mean nothing to a master,
but only humble actions! In short, I want you to recall the change of your name.
If you are not willing to do this you cannot reckon on any cooperation from my
side in future times.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yours sincerely, (Dieter Rueggeberg).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As Jim Milligan was not disposed to undo his change of name I mailed the
following circular letter to a number of people who were subscribers of
Milligans &quot;Franz Bardon News&quot; as I did know:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dear friends of Hermertics,</P>
<P>attached is a copy of my letter dated June 22, 1987 addressed to Jim
Millligan, the founder of the &quot;Franz Bardon Foundation&quot;, on occasion
of the change of his name. Meanwhile I received his answer with the statement
that he is not willing to recall his decision. This forces me to distance myself
from all further activities of the &quot;Franz Bardon Foundation&quot;. 
</P>
<P> It is quite clear,  to anyone who is studied in psychology that such a
change of name has nothing to do with love and adoration but is just a mask for
jealousy and hate. Any good psychiatrist knows about this problem.
</P>
<P>I regret this development, because the basic ideas were quite promising and
could have been a real help for the work of Franz Bardon. However, as long as I
am the executor I have to watch what is done under the name of Franz Bardon and
try my best to keep it clean from all sorts of rubbish.</P>
<P>Just a few sentences to the &quot;Training Guide &quot; by Jim Milligan. The
chapter 5 &quot;Making your own basic sigil necklace&quot; especially must be
considered as a nonsense from the true hermetic standpoint for several reasons.
The main reason is what Master Bardon told us in &quot;The Practice of Magical
Evocation&quot; on page 144 (4th edition): &quot;However, it is not wise to wear
an amulet for a long time with the sign of a Being, for the magician would
become too dependent on the Being and could lose his equilibrium and magical
authority.&quot; This is meant for the full developed magician !! The beginner
should keep away from any attempt to contact spiritual Beings directly or
indirectly if he does not intend to make his way as a sorcerer. For the beginner
it is quite enough to pray to his Guardian Angel who will always try to reach
the very best for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</P>
<P>During the past months I have been very busy to write my first own book,
which is nearly ready now. I hope to have the German edition until the end of
the year and will then try to make the English edition in the next year.</P>
<P>Be wakeful and pay attention,<BR>yours sincerely,<BR>Mit freundlichem
Gruss,<BR>Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="bml">On the &quot;Bardon-M&uuml;ller-Liga&quot;
(BML)</A></H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">by Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg (27. August 1997)</P>
<P>(Annotation by Paul Allen: The Bardon-M&uuml;ller-Liga was founded by  Mr.
Cuno-H. M&uuml;ller 196? in Switzerland and dissolved 1971.)</P>
<P>Only some months ago I got a copy of the newsletter of the aforementioned
Liga. Because presently there gather some elements in order to cheat people
spiritually and  economically with similar methods that have been used by the
Bardon-M&uuml;ller-Liga, and because the Name of Franz Bardon is connected with
these activities, I feel moved to comment briefly about it, though overburdened
with ongoing work. Furthermore I'm always asked to take position if some
impostor claims and publishes wrong assertions about Bardon's  works or if
someone harmed economically starts to get suspicious.</P>
<P>First some quotations from the aforementioned newsletter &quot;Bring mehr
Licht!&quot; Zeitung Nr. 3 vom  17.3.1965 Herausgeber C.-H. M&uuml;ller, Seite
20 (&quot;Bring more light&quot; issue nr. 3 dated 17. March 1965; editor C.H. M&uuml;ller,
page 20):</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">-------------</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;These previous descriptions by Mr. Tesch did arouse a lot of
cheerfulness and amusement, but also some astonishment about the &quot;master&quot;
and, though the forced retention on the side of Mr. Tesch, I was confirmed in my
opinions which I got from other sources: Franz Bardon could not have been the &quot;Great
Initiate&quot;, as it was believed by a lot of blind-faithful adorers. After the
meeting I talked confidentially with Mr. Tesch and I got the impression, that he
did know some other facts about Franz Bardon, which cannot be brought in
accordance with his teachings. Yet I don't like to criticize the author of the &quot;Quabbalah&quot;
in this respect, but I would like, in the sake of the truth, to admonish the
members of this order:
</P>
<P><B>Don't experiment wildly with the formulas and other teachings by Franz
Bardon; nobody has to buy Franz Bardons books, who attends a course with our
formulas, and who did not get them previously. Report by a personal acquaintance
of Franz Bardon.</B>  (Comment by Paul Allen: I don't understand what this last
sentence is for.)</P>
<P>I won't recommend any of these books for buying in our BML-news, in order
that nobody is seduced to perform &quot;follies&quot; and &quot;experiments&quot;
which consequences were not foreseen by Franz Bardon as he wrote his books,
though he implemented some warnings.</P>
<P><B>All the good from the 'Quabbalah' will always be used by ourselves and
its use will be authorized by me. But if somebody 'tries' to use other formulas,
he has to take all consequences and should not blame it on me but on the author</B>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">-------------</P>
<P>Franz Bardon described in his book &quot;The key to the true Quabbalah&quot;
the requirements which everyone has to meet in order to be able to work with the
science of Quabbalah  in a clear way: There it reads on page 10:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Whoever wants to deal with Theurgy has to master first all exercises
of my first book 'Initiation into Hermetics'.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Everybody who experiments with the 'Quabbalah' without the proper
preparation must therefore be prepared to get nothing at all and has to blame
all bad side effects on his own stupidity or carelessness. In this respect there
is no difference between natural and spiritual science: wrong application leads
to harm.</P>
<P>Coming from Prague in 1970 or '71 to bring Mr. M&uuml;ller some translations
by Otti Votavova I could meet only the second chairman of the BML whose name was
B&auml;ttig or B&auml;ttich if I remember correctly. He told me, that Mr.
Cuno-H. M&uuml;ller had left the Liga to join another order, and that he would
try to  carry the Liga on. After this meeting I never heard again about him or
Mr. M&uuml;ller</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;The Practice of Magical Evocation&quot;</H2>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">by Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg (27. August 1997)</P>
<P>Some authors claim that by not means it's necessary to get first the
required spiritual development to be able to get into contact with the spirits
mentioned above. To demonstrate the irresponsibility of such claimings everyone
has only to read the requirements cited below:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>&quot;To be able to put into practice Evocational-Magic, as explained in
my second book, you have to master completely my first book, which describes the
first Tarot-card 'The Magician', at least up to step 8, in order to achieve
satisfactory results also with Evocational-Magic.&quot;</B><BR>(Original
translation by  Peter Dimai, page 9 of PME:<BR>&quot;The practical application
of what I am going to say about exorcism in this, my second volume will only
become possible for the reader who has attained the goal of my first book: a
thorough command of the mysteries of the first tarot-card, or at least of the
facts laid down in my first volume up to and including Step 8. Only then will
the reader be able to achieve satisfying results.&quot;)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(The following quotation is not included in R&uuml;ggeberg's material. PA)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>PME, p. 92:<BR> &quot;I should also mention the fact that a passive
relationship is also possible with spirits of the astral plane and with spirits
of higher zones. This passive intercourse however is not so effective and does
not give such great magical results as the practice of evocation. <B>Also in
this case an unexpected pact could be the final outcome, and the person taking
up the connection by this passive intercourse is sometimes even worse off than
the sorcerer or necromancer, since he has no control at all over the spirit with
which he has taken up connection, or over the effects caused by it.&quot;</B>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>R&uuml;ggeberg continues to quote Bardon ...</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>PME, p. 92:<BR> &quot;There are two principle kind of this passive
intercourse: the first is a spiritistic one: the spiritist himself is the medium
for the contact and intercourse with the spirit, either by clairvoyance,
clairaudience, automatic writing etc.; the second possibility for passive
intercourse is that a hypnotist or a mesmerist takes up the connection with the
spirit by means of a somnambulant medium and maintains the contact continuously.
If the hypnotist or spiritist has not undergone any magic training and if,
therefore, has not the necessary degree of magical development and maturity, the
health of the medium is endangered in both cases. Many mediums and spiritists
who have often made use of it, so that they finally became dependent on that
spirit - which actually results in an indirect pact - have had to pay for it
with severe diseases of the mental, astral and physical body. Many a lunatic
asylum could bear witness for such deployable cases.&quot;<BR> &quot;All I have
said above especially applies to the work of sorcerers  and necromancers with
negative powers and the dangers involved. In this connection I should like to
point out that the genuine magician, who having come along the path of true
development tries to get into contact with positive spirits irrespective of
their rank or zone, he should not become dependent even on good spirits or
intelligence. He may if he likes, get into touch with a good spirit any time he
wishes, but he should not join any spirit even if he is especially attracted by
it, for if he does, a pact could also be the result, similar to such with
negative spirits, though the dangers for a genuine magician operating with
positive spirits could never be so great nor so tragic.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These quotations should suffice to warn improperly prepared people not to
use carelessly the names and sigills of the spirits mentioned by Bardon. All
harms which may arise from any talismanic work with names and sigills definitely
cannot be blamed on Franz Bardon.</P>

borrowed most</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">of his  teachings from Wilhelm (Rah Ohmir) Quintscher</H2>

<P>Because professor Adolf Hemberger (see also:
<A HREF="javascript:if(confirmed('http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/hemberge.html'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/hemberge.html'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6243/hemberge.html">Who was Dr.
Adolf Hemberger ?</A>) disseminated over years the lie, that Franz Bardon
borrowed his wisdom from Wilhelm Qintscher, I sent the following letter to the
son of W. Quintscher to clarify the matter. To my surprise there was no reply to
my letter. This means, that Mr. Ernst Quintscher was not interested at all in
clarifying the issue. I realy regret this fact, because Mr. Ernst Quintscher was
perhaps the only person who had information regarding the correspondence of
Franz Bardon and Wilhlem Quintscher. Unfortunately the death of Ernst Quintscher
makes it impossible to shed light on this matter.<BR> As far as I know, neither
Franz Bardon was the student of Wilhelm Quintscher nor vice versa. Both gained
their magical wisdom independently of each other. I don't know when the two
first met. However they had been good friends.</P>
<P>To Mr.<BR> Ernst Quintscher<BR> Seestr. 14<BR> 2320 Pl&ouml;n<BR><BR>
13.6.1985<BR><BR> Dear Mr. Quintscher, (Sehr geehrter Herr Quintscher)<BR><BR>
..., with this letter I would like to clarify some points which maybe have been
misinterpreted.<BR> During the time I compiled &quot;Frabato&quot; I didn't
know where you lived, otherwise if I had known it, I would have asked you about
the relationship between your father and Franz Bardon. For years Franz Bardon
had been accused by Dr. Hemberger of plagiarism. For this reason I mentioned
your father in &quot;Frabato&quot;. It was never my intention to disparage your
father by these sentences in Frabato and I assure you that he had always had my
greatest appreciation. At this time there was no reason to doubt the statements
made by Otti Votavova. Though I didn't know Franz Bardon personally, I claim
that he didn't copy his wisdom from other authors. In a future new edition of
Frabato I will cancel the points in concern. It is a pity, that the papers of
your father have not been published systematically in these times. Also
publishing your memories about your father would certainly have been greatly
appreciated by many students. This would have made it impossible for a lot of
profiteers to make a lot of money by selling your fathers writings though 
copyrights rightfully belonged to you.<BR> Best regards,<BR> Dieter R&uuml;ggeberg.</P>
