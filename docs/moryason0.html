<blockquote>To close this brief&nbsp; expose on Magic,&nbsp; I can only
evoke the Great Magus, he who through the ages, by different names and
bodies, transmitted this illustrious science to mankind.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
the past he was called "Light of Thoth" and steles, at present destroyed,
said that young girls, while&nbsp; washing their linen on the banks of
the Nile, sang of&nbsp; his splendor&nbsp; which equalled to a burst of&nbsp;
sunshine through the moire mists of a spring dawn.&nbsp; It was also said:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " 0h thou! N...&nbsp; , thou so young,&nbsp;
who did make Thee so great in the eyes of&nbsp; Pharaoh?"
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this question, the answer was always the
same:&nbsp; "It's the breath of the Great Serpent of knowledge, who only
has the power to rise up."
<p>At that time, he was called "Heroomos" which means " Son of&nbsp; Heroo"&nbsp;
Hor, Horus, the living God..&nbsp; The Greeks transformed his name which
became" Hermes Trismegistos",&nbsp; great three times over.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reconstituated&nbsp; the sparse knowledge
Egypt inherited from Atlantis, purified, polished it, and cast the foundations
of the whole Science. (See note 25).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he appeared in Greece.&nbsp; Christ's
secret companion, like the savior,&nbsp; he went to Tibet.&nbsp; He travelled
everywhere in the Eaast and Europe,&nbsp; came the banks of the " Sequana"
in Gallic country and buried in a small island of this river a stone of
mighty&nbsp; electromagnetism so that Life, Culture and Civilization&nbsp;
might emerge&nbsp; from that&nbsp; spot&nbsp; in the following centuries.&nbsp;
It was Lutecia, Paris.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the marvels of not only his deeds, but
also the emanations of his own nature, the Ancient told of him:&nbsp; "in
those days God was among Men".&nbsp; The early Christians, ignoring the
profound reality of this being and what&nbsp; bounds linked him to their
Master, offended by the veneration this great Magus was the object of,
defamed.... Apollonius,&nbsp; the Tyanean(See note 26).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was known in China and then again&nbsp;
several times in Europe, notably in the 18th century (see note 27) in order
to discreetly help Humanity lift the yoke of the powerful.&nbsp; However,
in all his comings, he enriched human knowledge and illustrated Magic.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When in the 20th century the world faced a
conflict between the forces of Light and the miasmas of darkness&nbsp;
and because practices of black magic&nbsp; founded&nbsp; one ideology and
supported the bellicose actions of certain nations...he came again (See
notes 21 and 28).&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown among&nbsp; humans he counterbalanced
(with the help of the Beings of light) the demonic forces thrown upon our
poor humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he has done in the previous centuries,&nbsp;
he taught anew, with the simplicity and heart-felt love of those who are
truly 'Great' and redivulged the true foundations of Magic.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As extraordinary as it may&nbsp; seem to the
reader, I&nbsp; beg to render homage to the one who&nbsp; departed&nbsp;
world in 1958 and&nbsp; whose name and apparent life were of a banality
inversely proportionate to his greatness...Franz BARDON. .

<blockquote>(Note 25)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hermes Trismegistos lived in 14 century BC.&nbsp;&nbsp;
His wisdom and knowledge were such he was compared to the God Thoth, Lord
of Magic in Egypt.&nbsp; After nearly thirty-four centuries, it's understandable
that a confusion was made and that mythic assimilation was perpetuated.
<br>Note of the translator: Was he Semenkhkare, high priest and co- ruler
of Egypt with Akhenaton?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Note 26)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apollonius of Thyana was born in Cappadoce
at the beginning of the first century of our era and died at a very advanced
age... thus he was a contemporary of Jesus.&nbsp; His marvelous life was
related by his disciple Damis of Niniveh, and this account was picked up
two centuries later by Philostratus.&nbsp; Apollonius took away the Egregore
of the occidental esoteric tradition from the use of men and ordered his
disciples to transport to northern India, in the following century (the
Second) , the most precious manuscripts about this holy knowledge, before
the cruel ravage that&nbsp; officially destroyed Ancient&nbsp; Wisdom.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Note 27)
<p>Concerning this Adept that also incarnated in the 18th century and whose
name "The Count of St. Germain" marveled all the greats of his time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
H.P. Blavatsky precised, "The Count of&nbsp; St. Germain certainly was
the greatest oriental adept Europe has seen for long centuries.&nbsp; However
Europe didn't know him.&nbsp; Perhaps some people will recognize him during
the next 'terror' that will burden all Europe and not a single country
when it comes." (Theosophical Glossary, page 360 French edition, Edition
Adyar, 1981). These lines were written more than fifty years before the
realization of this prophecy.&nbsp; (See note 21 and 28).
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Note 21)&nbsp; This note is about why it's now possible for&nbsp; everyone
to embrace Magic and Theurgy:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, for humanity has almost balanced a karma
that it has dragged a long for millennia, its "Atlant karma" linked to
the most monstrous practice to be ever done of black magic...This karma
accounts for the horrors it went through for thousands of years, plunged
in ignorance and deprived of the efficient means of freeing itself from
the density of terrestrial matter.&nbsp; Those means, it had them, although
it had no recollection.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it over abused them...The last
two world wars almost evacuated this karma.&nbsp; It is in anticipation
of the latter that the hermetic doctrine was divulged again at the end
of the last century and only after 1945 the diffusion of magic, in its
authentic sense, was permitted by Cosmic Law:&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1956 and 1957
the master piece of all esoteric literature about Magic was published:&nbsp;
Franz Bardon's books.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Note 28)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of " Frabato the Magician", autobiographic
account of part of the life of this great Magus during nazism...He performed
during World War II a very important occult work while humanity was facing
a karma it had dragged along since Atlantis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The count of&nbsp;
St .Germain also did a capital occult work during the "Terror" product
of the French Revolution.&nbsp; It is not without reason that the same
name history attributed to the dramatic situation in France at the end
of the 18th century is used to describe what happened during World War
II:&nbsp;&nbsp; " The Terror".
