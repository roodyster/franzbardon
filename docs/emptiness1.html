<p>More considerations about the Emptiness of Mind exercise.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Since the emptiness of mind state is so essential to the upcoming
magician and we have seen a number of postings to the FB-Forum questioning
about this technique I will cover this subject a bit more in depth and
add an account on how I experienced the training process.
<p>First we should try to define what we mean when talking about emptiness
of mind. Many definitions are possible here but I like to term it as: "the
absence of ..." Fill out the 3dotted space with the concept you like most
(=which you experience most in your ordinary state of mind) and you have
the definition which meets your needs best. This brings us to a consideration
which is very important in my opinion: Many possible states of emptiness
are possible with a varying degree of proficiency or experience. To complicate
things further is the fact, that every human being has a different frame
of mind in his ordinary state of consciousness which then has to be banished
in order to reach the emptiness state.
<p>Why is emptiness necessary for the beginning magician? The answer to
this question is quite obvious: you first have to make some place in your
mind throwing out all unnecessary rubbish before you can put something
new into its place. Magic is, in part, learning new abilities and in order
to be able to progress quickly you must be able to concentrate = focus
your mind onto the new ability you want to acquire.
<p>Say you're a very good cook and you're therefore thinking most times
about dishes to serve next. Probably you'll see in your mind pictures of
various types of food, smelling and tasting them to some degree and commenting
the scenes by your inner voice. Now when you want to learn say transplanting
consciousness and you have all the time pictures of rice dishes, fish,
second plates, salads, potatoes and so on popping into your minds eye how
will you be able to transplant your consciousness? Of course you can learn
it regardless weather you master the emptiness state or not, but it will
be a more difficult and even painful process. On the other hand, if you
master emptiness in the first place&nbsp; then you can enter most times
this state of peace and tranquillity and later move on to concentrate on
your chosen faculty.
<p>When beginning to train emptiness of mind most of us experience to be
pulled back to our usual way of thinking all the time, i.e. in our case
to think about dishes and food (Disclaimer: it's only an example: I won't
say here that cooks are thinking only about their profession).
<br>For a certain period when I practiced this exercise it was customary
to me to check how long it took me to realize that a new thought-train
had begun to run. Sometimes it took me about 1-2 or even up to 5 minutes
to realize "oh, I'm just having a new thought, I must stop it immediately".
At other occasions I realized it almost immediately.
<p>Sometimes you will be trapped by a very interesting train of thoughts
and get so absorbed with it that you will forget completely your task namely
to train emptiness. In our example you could have a very good idea about
a dish which may fascinate you and you would like to follow this idea more
thoroughly. In my personal experience this occurred very often: a most
enjoyable but nevertheless distracting experience?. Never before had I
experienced such compelling ideas and fascinating thoughts as when I sat
down trying to enter the emptiness state. I had to learn first to relinquish
the temptation to follow these fantastic avenues of mind until I was able
to move on with emptiness.
<p>Another point encountered by most beginners is that it's almost impossible
to enter a quiet state not to say emptiness if you have had previously
any upsetting emotion. Such emotions are constantly generating new thoughts
in your mind and you have no chance to banish them. This is one reason
why it's very important to get your emotional state balanced.
<p>A further point to consider is that when you get your very first success
you will immediately start to think about it. Say you succeeded in not
having any thought or picture for 30 seconds or so. At a certain moment
you will get very exited about this accomplishment and you are likely to
begin commenting about it like: Wow, I'm doing it, it's great, I never
thought to be able ..., hey man what's this, stop now, this is just a new
thought, oh shit, why must I always comment on everything... (and so on).
First you will get angry whenever such a thing happens, but after more
practice you just accept it as a normal thing which happens now and then.
<p>One more interesting fact about emptiness is that most people will have
sooner or later strange and/or unfamiliar feelings and experiences. In
my case it was most surprising to me that after a certain amount of training
the region of the "third eye" (you know, the region between the eyebrows)
began to pulsate. A most pleasant feeling but nevertheless it was distracting
me from my task: emptiness. Other feelings I got at this stage are very
hard or even impossible to describe. Simply because we have no adequate
vocabulary for such things. For example I felt like something of myself
was pulled like a rubber band and I expanded to somewhere I can't explain
but very 'distant'. By having such feelings again I lost track of my wish
to get to emptiness of mind. But all these experiences were transitory
in nature.</blockquote>

<p><br>Next I will discuss how it's like to experience the first periods
of real emptiness.
<p>(To be continued in a few days ...)
